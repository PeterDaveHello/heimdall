California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) said it suspended Cruise's autonomous vehicle deployment and driverless testing permit, ending efforts by the company for the time being to test the cars without safety drivers. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"Based upon the performance of the vehicles, the department determines the manufacturer's vehicles are not safe for the public's operation,\" the DMV said in a statement, citing \"an unreasonable risk to public safety.\" The DMV added that Cruise had \"misrepresented any information related to safety of the autonomous technology of its vehicles.\" The state agency said Cruise is allowed to challenge the suspension within five days. The company did not say if it planned to do that. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The suspension, following a series of accidents involving Cruise vehicles, is a major setback to the self-driving business that GM has called a major growth opportunity and to the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry. But unionized transit workers and other critics of robotaxis hailed the suspension, which was effective immediately. \"This could be a big blow to Cruise,\" said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina. \"This plays into the narrative about the technology and the companies failing. The whole industry will suffer as a result.\" Advertisement · Scroll to continue Report this ad Cruise said in a statement: \"We will be pausing operations of our driverless AVs in San Francisco. Ultimately, we develop and deploy autonomous vehicles in an effort to save lives.\" Cruise said the DMV was reviewing an Oct. 2 incident, where one of its self-driving vehicles was braking but did not avoid striking a pedestrian previously struck by a hit-and-run driver. \"When the AV tried to pull over, it continued before coming to a final stop, pulling the pedestrian forward,\" Cruise said. \"Our teams are currently doing an analysis to identify potential enhancements to the AV's response to this kind of extremely rare event,\" it added. The DMV order said Cruise had not initially disclosed all video footage of the accident and said \"Cruise's vehicles may lack the ability to respond in a safe and appropriate manner during incidents involving a pedestrian.\" Cruise could not immediately be reached to comment on DMV report the company had not initially shared all videos of the incident. GM executives have repeatedly called Cruise a giant growth opportunity, repeating that view during an earnings conference call on Tuesday before California's DMV announced its decision.

REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage Acquire Licensing Rights 'TREMENDOUS UPSIDE' \"We do believe that Cruise has tremendous opportunity to grow and expand,\" GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts. \"We ... see tremendous upside opportunity and growth.\" In June, Barra reiterated a forecast that Cruise could generate $50 billion a year in annual revenue by 2030. The company reported on Tuesday that it lost $723 million on Cruise during the third quarter. In her call before the ruling, Barra said Cruise robotaxis have better safety records than human drivers. In August, the DMV said it was investigating \"concerning incidents\" involving autonomous vehicles operated by Cruise in San Francisco and asked the company to take half its robotaxis off the roads. That month, a Cruise robotaxi was involved in a crash with an emergency vehicle in San Francisco. This month, U.S. auto safety regulators opened a probe into whether Cruise was taking sufficient precautions with autonomous robotaxis to safeguard pedestrians. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it has received two reports from Cruise of incidents in which pedestrians were injured, and identified two further incidents via videos posted on websites. NHTSA said its investigation into Cruise remains open, but declined to comment on the California DMV action. Two months ago, California allowed Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Waymo and Cruise to take paying passengers day or night throughout San Francisco, a significant step. Waymo declined to comment on the DMV action. Critics of the self-driving technology pounced on the DMV decision. The Transport Workers union of America (TWU), which represents airline, railroad, and transit workers and has harshly criticized self-driving vehicles, said in a statement that companies like Cruise must meet measurable safety standards. \"Despite the propaganda pushed by tech executives, Cruise has shown the world that robots are incapable of even coming close to achieving the high standards human operators meet each and every day,” TWU President John Samuelsen said.

After coming to a complete stop, it then attempted to do a “pullover maneuver while the pedestrian was underneath the vehicle.” The car crawled along at 7 mph for about 20 feet, then came to a final stop. The pedestrian remained under the car the whole time.> The day after the incident, DMV representatives met with Cruise to “discuss the incident.” During that meeting, Cruise only showed footage up to the first complete stop, according to the Order of Suspension. No one at Cruise told the officers or showed any footage of the subsequent pullover maneuver and dragging. The DMV only learned of that from “another government agency.” When DMV asked for footage of that part of the incident, Cruise provided it.[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;4a3ba3&#x2F;california-dmv-suspen... Lonestar1440 14 hours agoprevFrom my perspective as a person who lives in San Francisco and also drives a LOT (10-20k miles per year, and many small drives within the city): Cruise cars do not perform acceptably.They manage to avoid collisions by driving extremely conservatively, but the way they traverse, say, a left turn against traffic is absurd. They slow everyone down, including emergency vehicles and public transit, by performing far below the level of most Human drives.They don&#x27;t work in the rain, they can&#x27;t handle construction, they block garages and driveways.Waymo vehicles are objectively far better. They drive like Humans do. Still some issued with weather and construction, but they work well alongside busses, trucks, and private cars without slowing anyone down. reply fhub 14 hours agoparentFrom my perspective, as a relatively early adopter of Waymo (60+ rides). I have zero gripes with the driving itself. In fact I&#x27;ve seen Waymos do things that no human would be able to do*. Drop-offs and pickups I&#x27;d like to see improvements made like getting a bit closer to the curb. Occasionally the route selections make no sense at all.* Waymo made a right turn up a steep hill. Two lanes each way. It then pulled a bit into the left lane abruptly and I didn&#x27;t get why until a split second later a skateboarder was crouched down and went by on my right against traffic. There was zero chance a human would pull that off. Not enough time for a head check or mirror check. There wouldn&#x27;t have been an accident but the Waymo clearly has insane reaction time and vision advantages - and uses them. reply pbarnes_1 12 hours agorootparentI saw a Waymo come to a screeching halt in a split second as a... less than intelligent individual... skateboarded in front of a bus, into the extremely busy road.If it was a human that person would have been dead, no question.Sometimes I&#x27;m riding in a Waymo (which I do every single day, 4x) and it does something, and I double take. Then a second later I see whatever it was it reacted to, and I&#x27;m like \"dang, why did I doubt you, robotic overload?\"The best part is that it works the same way in the day time vs the night time.Magic. reply mike_d 12 hours agorootparentWaymo is amazing, knowing some of the stuff they do behind the scenes to ensure safety - I would feel safer riding in a Waymo than driving myself.My biggest fear has always been that Cruise or Tesla would shit the bed so bad we don&#x27;t get any self-driving, either because of regulatory constraints or ruining the public perception of them. reply ehsankia 12 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. Glad California DMV is taking the more level headed approach here and evaluating them case by case based on merit. reply TuringNYC 9 hours agorootparentprevCan any engineers in the field comment on whether the [very cool!] Waymo vs Cruise performance anecdotes being discussed here would have been the result of Google&#x27;s millimeter-level scanning of SF? Or is it just better algos only? Or both? reply AustinDev 9 hours agorootparentCruise vehicles have sufficient sensor payloads to produce a &#x27;milimeter-level scanning of SF&#x27; with many fewer hours than they&#x27;ve been on the road there. I doubt that provides the biggest difference. It&#x27;s all down the software at this point. Especially because they&#x27;re not trying to do anything crazy like vision only. reply kbos87 5 hours agorootparentWe keep hearing this is crazy, but is there evidence to back that up? At this point with hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles logging millions of miles a month, I feel like we’d be hearing non-stop reports of destruction on the highways if it really is as crazy as the average HN reader has been led to believe. reply Galaxeblaffer 4 hours agorootparentthe only reason we don&#x27;t hear non-stop about destruction is that you&#x27;re required to keep both hands on the wheel&#x2F;yolk at ALL times while FSD is activated. comparing the current cameras on a Tesla to the human eye is just silly really, sure they cover 360 which is superior, but in almost any other way, the human eye is superior having better dynamic range, better contrast, better resolution and best of all, we have eye lids. if you would just sit down and think about it for 10 mins you&#x27;ll realize that gimping your self driving car by using cameras only is just a very very silly proposition when we have all this cool tech like lidar essentially giving the car super powers. reply kbos87 1 hour agorootparentIf FSD drivers were having to constantly intervene because the car couldn’t accurately map obstacles, we’d be hearing a lot more about it. I drive with FSD all the time - I could give you a list of things it needs to improve on, but not a single one has anything to do with its accuracy of understanding its surroundings. reply trogdor 4 hours agorootparentprev>with hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles logging millions of miles a month, I feel like we’d be hearing non-stop reports of destructionWhy do you believe that Tesla vehicles are driving millions of miles a month on autopilot?I suspect that autopilot accounts for a vanishingly small percentage of Tesla miles-driven. Mostly because it sucks, but also because of how hard it is to not miss a nag on a long road trip, with the result that you are locked out of autopilot until your next stop.(Yes, even when paying attention to the road, with your hands on the wheel. Hell, autopilot locks you out if you exceed 85 mph for more than a few seconds by pressing the accelerator, such as when passing. This is true even in places where the speed limit is 85 mph, and the slower end of the flow of traffic is 95 mph.)I love the performance of my Model S Plaid. Autopilot, however, is a joke. reply kbos87 1 hour agorootparentTesla reported that there were 400,000 cars in the US and Canada who had access to FSD Beta in January 2023, so I don’t think that’s at all hard to believe.Edit: Looks like back in January they were adding 10M cumulative miles driven per month (roughly) - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insideevs.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;633328&#x2F;tesla-fsd-beta-now-active-... reply F-W-M 2 hours agorootparentprev> This is true even in places where the speed limit is 85 mph, and the slower end of the flow of traffic is 95 mph.Once traffic rules are enforced by autonomous cars that don&#x27;t let you go over the speed limit, we can start raising the limit to more realistic levels. I guess currently it is priced in that everyone goes over by x km&#x2F;h. reply nohuck13 4 hours agorootparentprev\"This is true even in places where the speed limit is 85 mph, and the slower end of the flow of traffic is 95 mph.\"Where do you drive where the speed limit is 85 mph? reply gambiting 3 hours agorootparentPoland? 140km&#x2F;h is the motorway speed limit. Admittedly there aren&#x27;t that many Teslas here. But they are extremely popular in Germany and you see people drive them at silly speeds. reply flohofwoe 3 hours agorootparent\"Extremely popular in Germany\" is a bit of a stretch, from googling around, there are only around 40k Teslas out of 48 million cars overall in Germany (which is about 0.08%). reply gambiting 1 hour agorootparentWell, yes - I think what I really meant was that they are extremely popular[among electric cars]. Whenever I drive through Germany and stop at an autohof all tesla chargers are always occupied, and you see quite a lot of them on the roads just driving around. But you&#x27;re right, 40k is nothing in such a big country. reply shanti2001 3 hours agorootparentprevno reply gambiting 3 hours agorootparent>>noCare to expand? reply gundmc 3 hours agorootparentprevHighway 130 outside Austin, Texas has an 85 mph zone. replyqeternity 12 hours agorootparentprev> knowing some of the stuff they do behind the scenes to ensure safetyAny info on this?

When I saw Tesla releasing their half-backed crap I feared they will damage the public perception so badly that we wouldn&#x27;t have self-driving cars for years. reply nonethewiser 5 hours agorootparentprev> Waymo is amazing, knowing some of the stuff they do behind the scenes to ensure safetySuch as? reply unshavedyak 12 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t wait till those are generally available. I&#x27;d go out more if i could have a nice night and not have to deal with coming home later. Hell i live about 1.5h from Seattle and i never go because it&#x27;s just awful (to me) dealing with cars there. If i could get a cab all the way there and back? Oh man, amazing. Or even park and ride would be nice. Cities seem so much more approachable to me if i don&#x27;t need to drive them. It&#x27;s a me-issue, for sure, but still. reply fhub 12 hours agorootparentThe current ride pricing feels about 10-20% less than an Uber in SF - but I haven&#x27;t really checked properly. So don&#x27;t expect the rideshare product (Waymo One) to be a super cheap option. reply gmassman 12 hours agorootparentThis morning my coworkers rode in together in a Waymo. One told me it was $16 while an Uber would have been $35. reply fhub 11 hours agorootparentFrom my personal experience they are priced cheaper for all rides. But rarely that much cheaper - perhaps a surge time?The variable that differs is time to pickup. I&#x27;ve found Waymo is generally pretty good for me in off-peak times - perhaps on average 2-3 minutes further away on average. But I have got the odd \"20 minutes away\" and I then just order an Uber.But I will always pick a Waymo over an Uber if they are the same distance away. I love playing my own music and just being in my own world without another human to consider. It is truly a relaxing commute. reply KKKKkkkk1 4 hours agorootparent> But I will always pick a Waymo over an Uber if they are the same distance away. I love playing my own music and just being in my own world without another human to consider. It is truly a relaxing commute.Not to ruin your commute, do you know if there are interior-facing cameras monitoring the passengers? reply nemothekid 8 hours agorootparentprevAre you able to play music on the car speakers from your phone? The process on iPhone seems very awkward (talking to google assistant instead of just selecting a song). reply fhub 6 hours agorootparentI do it the awkward way too. But I typical play an artist that I loved two decades ago and crank the volume. So \"My music\" wasn&#x27;t the best way to describe it. More music that is just for me. I don&#x27;t find their inbuilt music channels you can play from the center console to be that good. There is lots of UX things that could be done with music that wouldn&#x27;t be hard. reply willsmith72 10 hours agorootparentprevisn&#x27;t that just because the waymos are still funded by VCs? an uber might&#x27;ve been the same 10 years ago, but now they&#x27;ve achieved world domination it&#x27;s time to make a profit reply semiquaver 9 hours agorootparentWaymo is fully owned by a public company. Economically they are indistinguishable from Uber (other than having a huge ad profit center to subsidize them). What VCs are you referring to? reply svachalek 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s still in the R&D phase though. It&#x27;s not out there to make a profit like Uber or Lyft. reply xnx 9 hours agorootparentWaymo is definitely in the phase where they want to form a positive impression on all fronts: safety, convenience, price. Once widespread, it&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;ll charge more than Uber because of the extra privacy and safety in a Waymo ride. reply AlexandrB 6 hours agorootparentNot to mention that Waymo will have to own their fleet and can&#x27;t quietly pass depreciation costs onto their drivers like Uber does. reply shiroiuma 6 hours agorootparentprev>Once widespread, it&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;ll charge more than Uber because of the extra privacy and safety in a Waymo ride.It&#x27;s possible, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something you can assume. Having to pay for a chauffeur isn&#x27;t cheap, and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing with Uber. A robotaxi avoids that cost since it drives itself. reply arcticbull 5 hours agorootparentEngineers are significantly more expensive than chauffeurs, especially since the chauffeurs get paid roughly minimum wage - or less. I too am very curious where pricing settles out. reply fallingknife 5 hours agorootparentOnly if there is one engineer per car reply arcticbull 4 hours agorootparentWell no, it depends on the multiple. Minimum wage is $15000, and an engineer costs Google an average of at least 10X that in base salary, plus another 10X that in equity. I think the break-even is probably closer to 20 cars per engineer.Currently they have ~250 cars in SF, and 2,500 employees of which about 600 are engineers.To break even I&#x27;d say they probably need at least 12,000 cars, assuming they don&#x27;t hire any more engineers and the other 1,900 employees are costless. This also assumes that the cost of the Waymo is exactly the same as a regular car, which at least today, isn&#x27;t even close. And that the server infrastructure is free, and that insurance is comparable. It&#x27;s probably also too early to know what the maintenance cost of these systems is compared to a vanilla vehicle. reply shiroiuma 4 hours agorootparentGiven how many taxis a typical city has, there&#x27;s no way that the cost of engineers would come close to the cost of chauffeurs.In fact, this is the way economics work for many forms of automation: you&#x27;re replacing a large amount of labor time with a much smaller amount of engineering time. The engineering time is more expensive of course, but the much smaller amount more than makes up for the increased cost. replythrowaway290 5 hours agorootparentprevLitigating accidents will cost more because suddenly it&#x27;s not \"partner\" at fault but your own people. Also, someone&#x27;s gotta buy that new yacht somehow... replybelltaco 7 hours agorootparentprevI read that Waymo is losing 2 to 3 billion dollars a year. reply tanseydavid 6 hours agorootparentUber lost $9.1B in 2022.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fourweekmba.com&#x2F;uber-losses-by-year&#x2F; reply superfrank 5 hours agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t forget no pressure to tip your Waymo reply morelisp 3 hours agorootparentThere will be. \"Donate $1 to Waymo&#x27;s autonomous safety research fund?\" reply bbarnett 1 hour agorootparentNo, it will be the United Way. Or to help give poor children blankets.And it will be offered, when Waymo&#x27;s onboard AI detects you&#x27;re on a date, verbally, so the date can hear.So even if you give to charites in a meaningful way, you&#x27;ll end up doing it again or look crass and be embarrassed. And as with many of these \"at the till\" charity collections, there is a fee given to the collector.Who will be Google! Plus, not only do they get to track your co-riders, eg who you associate with, and where you go, and even all conversation in the car (anonymized, of course), now they get to track your charitable predilections, by offering choice. reply mattsan 55 minutes agorootparentOk so say hypothetically they have the balls to record conversations in your car. Wouldn&#x27;t they already be recording from your pocket?(I know it&#x27;s sarcasm and you&#x27;re spot on about the charities lmao) reply bbarnett 25 minutes agorootparentI wonder though.You own the phone. And they mostly get in trouble for lying about the things they record on phone, not for doing it.But they own the car. And is it illegal for a cabbie to listen, and then tell their boss a stock tip, or that the Jones are buying a new house?To add distance, they could real time listen in car, process locally, and only upload highlights as tags&#x2F;text, so no recording. They could also process live, and then offer services in ride, eg \"notice your hair is shaggy, Google Maps says this is a good barber!\", and of course if you want that referral, as a barber, Google Maps you pay.Google can&#x27;t help itself. It is like a kleptomaniac, it knows it shouldn&#x27;t, but for those voices in its head(managers), do it.. do it! You know you want to, you need to, you should!Oh it&#x27;s so shiny oh god...And it relents, turning all pure dreams into ashes.Waymo will be the ultimate platform to know even more about you, and to monetize it further. replyraylad 8 hours agorootparentprevLast time I checked (in SF), Uber was $16.70 for a ride I wanted to take and Waymo was $25.40.All things being equal (or anywhere near equal), I&#x27;ll pay the human driver rather than the bot. reply selestify 1 hour agorootparentFunny, I’d choose the opposite. reply runarberg 8 hours agorootparentprevIf feel like Seattle needs an all day and weekend Sounder service, more than it needs self driving robo-taxis. 1.5 hours away you might be at the edge or beyond Sounder reach so this may not help you much unless you get a local bus to your closest station, but you can probably still just drive to your closest station and not having to have to deal with driving in the city.If the Sounder would run like the ferries do (say every hour until like 8PM and then a couple more trips before midnight) it would really take the hassle of going to the city for much more people than robo-taxis ever could. reply Symbiote 7 hours agorootparentI am staring aghast with European eyes at a city of 4 million people where the commuter rail doesn&#x27;t run outside peak hours. How do you get home if you go out for a couple of drinks with colleagues, or stay late for a call?You shouldn&#x27;t be asking for a couple of trains between 8pm and midnight. They should be every half hour, or more! Midnight until 6am on Saturday and Sunday could be every hour or two.(I live in Copenhagen, half the population of Seattle. Commuter trains run every 20 minutes from 5-24h, every 10 6-18, all night on Friday and Saturday nights. Other trains also run, and the metro is 24&#x2F;7.) reply coryrc 6 hours agorootparentWe taxpayers already spend >$30 per person-trip for the Sounder. It currently doesn&#x27;t connect well to transit on either end (most users drive to it), and half the city is fighting to make sure it doesn&#x27;t connect directly with the new \"light rail\" station. Also our light rail is longer end-to-end than the Paris metro and half the stations are on the freeway with massive parking garage and no pedestrian amenities. Riding transit in the Seattle area is insulting and demeaning.I&#x27;ve ridden the train in Copenhagen. The stops are near things! Stores and parks! Apartments and hotels! Shopping malls! Like, actually right there! There&#x27;s a few stops like that in Seattle, but they&#x27;re also the ones with junkies nodding off, con men \"looking for some gas money\", and other anti-social behavior. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 6 hours agorootparentprevIn the wee hours catching a train and bus to get home is kind of annoying in Malmö. Mainly the buses basically stop running more than once an hour between 1-5am.Most US towns are basically uber&#x2F;taxis only at that time. I live in Austin where you could theoretically be one of the lucky 1% of the population that both lives near a train station and wants to go somewhere near where that train station is. Even then you can’t use the train past something like 11pm on weekends. Capmetro’s hours are a pretty decent source of consternation for us here reply Symbiote 2 hours agorootparentMalmö is a fifth of the size of Copenhagen, or a tenth of Seattle. Once an hour at night isn&#x27;t so bad for a city that size, isn&#x27;t it? The trains to Copenhagen run all night, so I can get home... reply seanmcdirmid 5 hours agorootparentprevYa, nothing in the states is set up for that outside of maybe NYC. We just grew our urban planning post war based on cars. It is absolute insanity. Seattle is even considered one of the better cities for public transit. reply blincoln 5 hours agorootparentprevThe Sounder is a heavy rail train on rails that are shared with other trains (e.g. freight). It runs about 7 times per day in one direction and about 10 times per day in the other. There&#x27;s no reason to run additional trains on that line, because taking it depends almost entirely on finding an empty space in parking garages that are full by about 6AM.The Seattle area has a newer, dedicated light rail system (Link) that runs every 5-10 minutes from about 5AM to about 1:00AM. The stations are located much more conveniently and frequently, because they were placed based on where a commuter train should stop, not trying to piggyback on existing freight lines. There still isn&#x27;t as much parking as there should be, but at least the stations are placed so that more than a tiny handful of people can get there without driving and parking. reply runarberg 5 hours agorootparentI’m not so sure about that. The North line connects to Edmonds which is a major ferry terminal used by a fairly large number of people on the Kitsap peninsula, Port Townsend etc. plus another ferry terminal on Mukilteo for Whitby island. These are major connections which are unusable in the 4 trains a day frequency (Sounder only runs 2 trips and Amtrak Cascade the other 2; latter does not stop at Mukilteo). The link is good and all that but it won’t reach Everett for another 20 years and it won’t connect with the ferries either.The South direction is a little better (and is improving even further with more Cascade runs on the horizon) but it is the same story. For example, Pyuallup and Sumner are both decent sized towns wit centrally located station, which won’t get light rail and the 1 line won’t reach Tacoma until 2035 at least. There is also a decent transit center at Lakewood, however I would argue it should probably be better to run the 620 all the way to Tacoma, from where Olympia people could jump onto a Sounder or light rail. reply TaylorAlexander 7 hours agorootparentprevI feel this way too, having gone down the online rabbit hole of urbanist content.

America really screwed itself by building cities for cars instead of people, and it&#x27;s hard to change this at this point, especially when every effort at making cities there more walkable and dense is met with fierce opposition. reply TaylorAlexander 6 hours agorootparentAmerica has loads of cities and metro areas with way more density than European cities with effective rail systems. You’re right that it’s hard to change due to historical choices, but it may still be worthwhile to transition as soon as possible rather than continue down the wrong path. reply fallingknife 4 hours agorootparentDo we actually? European cities that I have been to all have zones with nothing but apartment buildings in dense urban configuration that go on for miles. I&#x27;ve never seen something like that in the states outside of NYC. reply runarberg 6 hours agorootparentprevI think the main problem with the Sounder is not a lack of density (Seattle and Tacoma are both plenty dense; also both the rail corridor and the rolling stock already exist; only missing expensive part is the crew) but rather it is on a very congested freight corridor (particularly the north part to Everett) owned partly by the freight company. So it is hard for Sound Transit to negotiate more usage of the corridor for increased frequency. reply runarberg 6 hours agorootparentprevI agree. I actually live a bit closer to Seattle then OP, only 40 min on bus + boat (add 20 outside of commuter hour for a second bus). The Sounder doesn’t actually run anywhere near me, (well I could take the 118 south to the Tahlequah ferry terminal, 10 min boat to Point Defiance, a Pearce transit bus to Tacoma, and ride the Sounder from there; which urbanists call the “long way”). so this doesn’t affect me personally.But you are absolutely right, Tacoma and Everett are 3rd and 4th largest cities in the state and are in the same metro area as Seattle. The north line is actually worse, only 2 trains a day (plus 2 Amtrak Cascade trains) even though there is major Ferry terminal connection at Edmonds (and a smaller but significant at Mukilteo). The Sounder service is dismal and needs to be improved (thankfully we are getting more service on the Amtrak Cascades which runs the same corridor but goes all the way to Portland and Vancouver BC. but not nearly enough)That said, the bulk of the population in the Seattle metro area is serviced with the Link light rail. They are almost done with an extension east to Bellevue (turns out building rail on a floating bridge is hard) and eventually it will reach both Tacoma and Everett. Then they will get the frequency they deserve.As for me, how do I get home. My ferries actually run all night (although with up to 3 hour gaps in the middle of the night) and frequently enough. If there isn’t a bus on the island, I usually just call my partner and she picks me up at the terminal, sometimes I also meet someone I know in the ferry.The funny bit is that I actually immigrated here from Europe, and my tiny European island in the North Atlantic actually has way worse public transit system as Seattle. So for me this is a huge improvement. I’m actually going home to visit and am planning to see a friend of my play at a concert it a town 40 min from the capital, but there are no buses, so I actually have to call my mom to pick me up when the concerts are done. reply Symbiote 1 hour agorootparentFaroes? I visited during Covid, so there was no need to try staying out late.But the population of the whole country is 1&#x2F;100 of Seattle. Buses in some place during the day, and taxis at other times, is proportionate to what&#x27;s available in Copenhagen.I grew up in a small village in England. Choices for a night out were staying over at a friend&#x27;s house (much preferable) or splitting the £15 taxi between several teenagers, which was a decent price as far as our parents were concerned. (Or walking for two hours and keeping the money, don&#x27;t tell mum.) reply seanmcdirmid 5 hours agorootparentprevI live in Ballard, so the sounder goes right by me. We (my kid and I) even watch it go by sometime. Nowhere near to get on, though, so I’ve actually never been on one before. It would be a cool way to link Ballard to downtown Seattle by rail before 2040. reply brewdad 5 hours agorootparentprevWhile we’re at it, could we get at least one late night&#x2F;overnight Amtrak Cascades train?

I parked my van at an angle, so if it was hit from behind it should roll past him. I jumped out and performed an assessment (I&#x27;m a qualified, OK: certificated first aider). I diagnosed \"pissed\" and ascertained he was unharmed. We got his bike in the back of the van with the help of some concerned pedestrians who initially thought I&#x27;d hit him. I drove him home.I&#x27;m not sure a machine would have noticed an odd lump next to a lamppost, with a civic rubbish bin next to it, in the rain. What sort of sensors do these Waymo things have? They will have to be really, really clever and seriously expensive.I don&#x27;t deny that eventually a vehicle with enough decent sensors and some fancy processing will outperform me but I&#x27;ve managed 30+ years on the road with just a few scratches, a broken wing mirror and a rear ending from an articulated lorry.I&#x27;ve managed to return a hire car around Napoli (Italy) after a couple of weeks without any issues! That may not sound too impressive but have a look at the state of vehicles around St Antonio Abate etc - it looks like the locals play bumper cars. May I also note that I&#x27;m a Brit and we drive on the left. Italians don&#x27;t. So I can adapt to local conditions. I have also driven across large parts of the rest of Europe and the north Americas.

Humans have evolved a way to intuit the thoughts and behaviors of other drivers. It’s why people who are mentally ill are unsettling; it’s very hard to pick up on their intentions and course of action. That’s why in think the hurdle isn’t “better than the average human driver.” Because humans won’t trust a machine in the same way as another human, the level of safety for AVs may have to be much, much greater before the public as a whole trusts them with safety critical decisions. reply __loam 5 hours agorootparentprevYes they can. They are absolutely capable of looking at gestures. That matters a lot more when you&#x27;re trying to determine the intent of a pedestrian than a driver. If it&#x27;s another driver, the system can also do real time physics calculations to avoid a vehicle straying into the av&#x27;s trajectory. And they might even do some kind of computer vision with other drivers to determine intent. Also if another driver just hits the car because they were distracted, why would the AV be at fault?These are really sophisticated systems and they&#x27;ve really thought of a lot of issues. All of these companies have hundreds, if not thousands of engineers who have been working on this problem for over a decade, as well as an army of lawyers trying to get things into compliance.

There was a vehicle waiting to also make an unprotected left in the other direction. Behind it was a truck. Waymo made that turn where I wouldn&#x27;t have. I thought it through after and it had at least two advantages over a human here. 1. It knew the car situation behind truck well before a driver would have considered it. 2. It&#x27;s front lidar could see around that truck earlier than a driver could. I still provided feedback that I&#x27;d have preferred it to not make that turn even if it was safe to do so.

Hell even in this very thread people are saying that about Cruise. Yet when they make it more aggressive, people feel unsafe.As you say, this is something they are constantly tweaking to find the perfect middle ground. That being said, maybe people are extra hyper aware of the turns when it&#x27;s a self driving car, and wouldn&#x27;t bat an eye or pay attention if it was a normal taxi driver? reply fhub 11 hours agorootparentFair point. When I take a passenger in a Waymo and it is there first time I&#x27;m hyper aware of the driving. But for myself personally, I&#x27;m mostly tuned out. For me it started to feel \"normal\" as early as about the 4th ride. So they could probably subtly adjust the \"middle ground\" based on the passenger&#x27;s experience and feedback (As long as it doesn&#x27;t create inconsistencies for surrounding vehicles). reply taneq 11 hours agorootparentprevPeople have an interesting “trust curve” regarding automation. At first they’ll be very suspicious and critical of it and any issues they have will be blamed on it.

That&#x27;s one of the conditions described in the accident investigation report for that Irish plane which smashed a bunch of runway lighting due to insufficient take off power.A brand new top of the line passenger jet would say e.g. \"Caution: Acceleration\" because it can work out the velocity of the plane, from there the acceleration and the remaining runway length (it uses GPS to identify the runway it&#x27;s on) and take off speed and conclude we won&#x27;t make it. Humans only decide that after it&#x27;s far too late. Because it&#x27;s much earlier the annunciation allows pilots to abort takeoff and investigate from the safety of the ground - in the Irish case they&#x27;d typed the wrong air temperature in and thus the engine performance was much worse than expected, with the right air temp it would have flown just fine reply mensetmanusman 7 hours agorootparentprevWith a limited understanding of truth and know, yes. reply layla5alive 10 hours agorootparentprevLOL.

I might have had the opposite reaction to you had my car not gone when it could. Also, you have greater visibility as a driver in the front than a passenger in the back, so it&#x27;s likely that an experienced SF driver might have also done the same thing (speaking as someone who&#x27;s driven in the city for over 20 years) reply fhub 7 hours agorootparentI get your point.

That was my first thought as well: crash data for humans is clearly underreported. For example, police don&#x27;t always write reports or human drivers agree to keep it off the books. reply CSMastermind 12 hours agorootparentThe probability of a human driver causing a fatality on any given mile driven is 0.00000109% (1.09 fatalities occur per 100 million miles driven).Applying some basic statistics to show to a 95% confidence level that a self driving system causes fewer fatalities than a human you would have to drive 275 million autonomous miles flawlessly.This would require a fleet of 100 vehicles to drive continuously for 12.56 years.And in practice self-driving vehicles don&#x27;t drive perfectly. Best estimates on the actual number of miles driven to validate their safety is around 5 billion autonomously driven miles and that&#x27;s assuming that they actually are safer than a human driver.Then you get into the comparison itself. In practice AVs don&#x27;t drive on all the same roads, at the same times, as human drivers. A disproportionate number of accidents happen at night, in adverse weather, and on roads that AVs don&#x27;t typically drive on.Then you have to ask if comparing AVs to all drivers and vehicles is valid comparison. We know for instance that vehicles with automated breaking and lane assist are involved in fewer accidents.Then of course if minimizing accidents is really what you care about there&#x27;s something easy we could do right now: just mandate all vehicles must have an breathalyzer ignition.

And like any actuary, you can compare distributions with finer granularity data (location, tickets, ages, occupations, collusion severity, etc). None of this is new or intractable. We can have objective standards with confident judgements of what’s safe for our roads.As an aside, public acceptance of driverless cars is another story. A story filled with warped perspectives due to media outlets stoking the audience emotions which keep outlets in business — outrage, fear, and drama.

(Although I worry a bit about automation-induced inattention negating these benefits) reply lemming 11 hours agorootparentThere are also issues like phantom braking which Teslas are prone to (or were, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s better these days). That&#x27;s part of a whole class of problems which the AVs suffer from which humans don&#x27;t. I think the main problem is that those problems are really unpredictable to human drivers, whereas good defensive drivers will take into account what another lousy human driver might do based on lots of experience. reply fiddlerwoaroof 10 hours agorootparentOn the other hand, if you’re following the car in front of you too close so you cannot react to phantom breaking, the accident is on you. One of the things I appreciate the most about using autopilot&#x2F;FSD everywhere is that the car maintains a safe following distance basically 100% of the time, even when someone cuts me off. Implemented (and used) consistently, this sort of adaptive cruise control by itself should solve a bunch of accident-causing hazards and other traffic issues.I haven’t had a phantom breaking issue in a long time either, I’m not sure if this is because of the FSD package or if the underlying autopilot system has improved. reply ajross 13 hours agorootparentprevDitto, FWIW. The car may not always behave like a human does in those circumstances[1], but at this point it&#x27;s objectively much better at the attention and recognition side of the task.[1] It tends to be more conservative than human drivers, and in weird ways. If a pedestrian seems at all to be moving in the direction of traffic, even if they&#x27;re on a sidewalk and just meandering a bit, the car will try to evade (not violently, but it will brake a bit and pull to the outside of the lane). reply fiddlerwoaroof 13 hours agorootparentYeah, if anything, my Tesla’s issues seem to stem from being overly concerned about accidents than being recklessly dangerous. reply thesz 13 hours agorootparentprevThe same applies to regular drivers.

It&#x27;s still \"un-human-driver-like\" in a bunch of surprising ways, but the actual meat and potatoes \"does it do more or less stupid stuff\" is I think ahead of my own driving at this point.At this point I trust its microdriving (lanekeeping, distance management, speed control, collision&#x2F;obstacle avoidance, etc...) more than my own for sure. The higher level stuff is still a mixed bag (will it get stuck at that merge, can it make this lane change in time, does it understand that this other car is going to yield or will it stop, etc...). reply Dylan16807 6 hours agorootparentCan it detect stationary obstacles at freeway speeds? Do we have good evidence? Because autopilot couldn&#x27;t. reply ajross 5 hours agorootparentMeh, we&#x27;ve been here before. That&#x27;s a vague and impossible point to argue. I mean, sure, yes it does. Does it for all possible obstacles? Probably not? I certainly haven&#x27;t tested. This kind of \"$SYSTEM must have feature $X which is possessed by $COMPETITOR or else it will fail\" is just plain bad analysis. It&#x27;s possible for a Tesla to (1) be a better driver than you on the whole while still (2) doing weird stuff that you&#x27;re sure you never would.FWIW: Stationary junk in the freeway causes accidents with human drivers every day, all the time. People are absolutely terrible at dodging crap in the road. But you and everyone else will swear up and down that you&#x27;d *never* drive over a shed tire or whatever, even though evidence says you totally would.Basically: no, you&#x27;ll never get the evidence you want to \"prove\" the logical construct you&#x27;ve created. So Teslas, to you, will never be \"safe\". But in the real world they obviously are. reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparent> to \"prove\" the logical construct you&#x27;ve createdYou&#x27;re making guesses about my standards that aren&#x27;t warranted at all. They absolutely can be met.First off I&#x27;m specifically worried about large objects, a meter or larger.And let&#x27;s see, autopilot has done 3 billion miles? Okay, if FSD can manage 1 billion miles of freeway driving with zero or one crashes into large objects, then I&#x27;ll be convinced they&#x27;re solving the problem.That should be fair, right?> But in the real world they obviously are.Obvious according to what?Autopilot wasn&#x27;t, because it managed to hit entire vehicles repeatedly. There is (or was) a specific warning in the manual that it might hit stationary vehicles when going over 50mph.What makes it obvious that FSD avoids this specific problem?> But you and everyone else will swear up and down that you&#x27;d never drive over a shed tire or whatever, even though evidence says you totally would.You made this up about me from nowhere.

Assuming incorrectly is the root cause of probably 99.999% of accidents. reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s driving without attention, there&#x27;s defensive driving, and then there&#x27;s ability to react to things which would be physically impossible for people to react to.

Someone stopping out of the blue when green is on is definitely a danger to all those around the car he&#x2F;she&#x2F;it is driving. Granted, that might not be the case somewhere in the middle of the US where there&#x27;s a car passing every 5-10 minutes or so. reply hnbad 2 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a lot of legitimate criticism in that short video but the presenter is also extremely dishonest and biased. E.g. they end the video saying that they started with \"a lot of optimism\" when at the beginning of the ride they literally said that they expected the car to be unsafe. They also seem to mock the AI for obeying traffic laws like speed limits and stop signs, which is a bad start for a video like this.Someone in the comments also mentions that the destination was in a dead end street, which may be the reason the drop-off is a 5 minute walk away. The 5 minute walk was also apparently indicated when she entered the destination. This along with the pick-up location being on the other side of the road feels like it might be the result of the AI being overly cautious. I&#x27;d find that acceptable for an \"autonomous car\" but not one advertised as a replacement for taxis (which as the presenter mentions are also used as accessibility aids where a 5 minute walk uphill can be unacceptable).There&#x27;s no footage of the car stopping at the green light, just her saying it&#x27;s come to a full stop and then an external shot where it&#x27;s already stopped. That&#x27;s not enough information to call the stop \"unsafe\", even if it was impeding traffic. It also stopped with flashing hazards, assuming Waymo doesn&#x27;t flash hazards during the entire ride (which I hope they don&#x27;t). It&#x27;s not clear why it stopped there but based on the little footage we have it doesn&#x27;t seem very abrupt so any traffic behind it would have had plenty of time to notice and react the decelerating car in front of them.The stop seems unnecessary and because it&#x27;s AI and Waymo didn&#x27;t provide additional information, it&#x27;s impossible to say what caused it. The message she saw also indicates it was caused by an error, presumably a navigation issue. Although it is impossible to tell based on the editing, the issue seems to have been resolved within a few seconds. A human driver would have probably decided to just follow the direction of traffic for that amount of time, or change lines to come to a full stop at the side of the road but in an urban environment (not at highway speeds) the behavior is not completely unreasonable. What&#x27;s more concerning to me is that the AI ran into a problem while in traffic that required the car to come to a complete halt and presumably wait for external (human?) intervention, green light or none.I&#x27;d prefer a car that slowly comes to a full stop at a green light because of a software issue over one that keeps dragging a pedestrian it ran over for several seconds to avoid impeding traffic but the bigger issue with Waymo here is that the car runs into a software issue at all while in traffic. reply babl-yc 13 hours agoparentprevI’ve got 5+ rides with each platform and would agree with this assessment. Cruise rides generally have a few uncomfortable moments per ride with some erratic swerving or sudden unexplained stops.Waymo rides feel much more predictable and human like.Although note that “human like” and “smooth” rides do not necessarily mean safer, but qualitatively Waymo feels that way. reply creddit 14 hours agoparentprevMy day-to-day experience with Cruises on the road is much better, mile for mile, than with human drivers.Cruise&#x27;s failures, in my view, have come broadly at the long tail where their cars stall out entirely in the road due and it cascades to other Cruises. reply bumby 13 hours agorootparent“The long tail” are usually what causes safety issues, though. Easily identifiable and relatively high probability events are the ones more commonly mitigated. The low-probability events are the ones that tend to fall through the cracks and tend not to be obvious except in hindsight. reply dopamean 14 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s literally no way you know this for a fact. reply creddit 13 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s literally no way in which I expressed it as being known as a fact by me.Did you make sure to reply like this to poster I replied to as well? reply pie420 13 hours agorootparentprevThe comment you are replying to starts with \"My day-to-day experience...\" reply dopamean 12 hours agorootparentYes and then go on to say something they could not possibly know for a fact. In my day to day experience Cruise cars are, mile for mile, far worse than human drivers . How could I possibly know that? I&#x27;ve had a couple bad encounters with Cruise cars but I&#x27;ve had countless encounters with human drivers in between all those. How could either of us possibly know which one is better \"mile for mile.\" It&#x27;s a ridiculous thing to say.

Not sure what this measures, but I&#x27;ve spent decades trying to gauge whether a design is one pixel off, or if some minor change has affected the layout of something. Maybe that was all preparation for slicing America in two using an Australia-shaped knife. reply nearbuy 3 hours agoparentThey seem to be fudging it a bit. In the first example with the circle, anything better than 45%-55% (as measured in my graphics editor) is reported as a perfect 50-50 split. reply raffraffraff 3 hours agoparentprev97% (5 perfect). I don&#x27;t know either. My guess is that most people are pretty good at judging what the half of something looks like. I feel like if the movement (on my phone anyway) wasn&#x27;t as jerky&#x2F;sticky I would have gotten one more perfect. I definitely had one that was very inaccurate (55&#x2F;45) though.Lol, I got the America&#x2F;Australia one perfect too! That surprised me! reply Cthulhu_ 13 hours agoparentprevI only got perfect score on the donut&#x2F;mug one... is this game trying to tell me something? reply gerdesj 12 hours agorootparentYou are Homer Simpson and I claim my £5, Mr Cthulu_.Err what are your pronouns, O tentacled horror of an old one (with a trailing ledge).I got 98% The two I cocked up I spent too long trying to align edges and geometry but actually it seems us humans do have a pretty decent hard wired equal area estimator built in.

The number of perfect cuts we&#x27;re all getting feels very unlikely to me. reply nearbuy 3 hours agoparentThey do appear to be fudging it. At least for first practice example with the circle, it appears to show a perfect 50-50 split when you&#x27;re up to 5% off (in area) in either direction. reply lifthrasiir 4 hours agoprevSix perfect cuts and two 53-47 splits (#6 and #8). For some shapes I was pretty analytical; for example #2 has 21 small squares, so I tried to first cover 11 squares then move it upward by a fifth of the unit. This approach apparently didn&#x27;t work well for irregular shapes. reply KyleBerezin 15 hours agoprevWhat a great ad.

But is there a good way to cut the cup, bird or map one without calculating it? I got lucky and got the cup exactly but I don&#x27;t think I could get close without just beeing lucky on the bird and map onea. reply latexr 17 hours agoparentThe cup is symmetrical and so is the donut shading, so the trick is to flip it on its head: instead of cutting the cup with the donut, cut the donut with the cup by ensuring either the top or bottom half of the donut overlays the cup. With that line of thinking I get a perfect split every time.No insights to share on the other ones, though. reply sinkwool 13 hours agorootparentCan you explain more? (I might be stupid and don&#x27;t see some obvious proof of why your approach is correct), but intuitively it doesn&#x27;t seem that the fact that the cup is symmetrical is enough. Say if the handle of the cup was really really big, while still preserving symmetry, then its outstanding area would be huge compared to what the doughnut could cover. reply latexr 13 hours agorootparent> Can you explain more?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;yE43nun.pnghttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;NTfbt5U.pngNote how the middle of the donut aligns with the bottom or top of the cup.> don&#x27;t see some obvious proof of why your approach is correctI’m not a mathematician; maybe I got lucky with my approach. Crucially this is a brain teaser so it plays by the rules of a game. I formulated an hypothesis by starting from the assumption that they give you a satisfactory fighting chance. reply sinkwool 12 hours agorootparentThanks for the reply and for the screenshots. before writing my initial reply, I went back and tried to get a 50&#x2F;50 split based on your comment and came up with the same solution. But I didn&#x27;t understand why it worked. I now believe it&#x27;s either pure luck, or there&#x27;s something about the sizes that result in a 50&#x2F;50 split.I think it&#x27;s easy to see that if the central hole of the doughnut were either smaller or larger, or if the handle of the cup was smaller or larger, these splits would not work.> I’m not a mathematician; maybe I got lucky with my approach. Crucially this is a brain teaser so it plays by the rules of a game. I formulated an hypothesis by starting from the assumption that they give you a satisfactory fighting chance.Sure, that&#x27;s fair, it&#x27;s just that your original explanation for how the solution is to swap the problem from splitting the cup to splitting the doughnut was so intriguing and puzzling that got me curious. reply gowld 16 hours agorootparentprevThat only works if the cup and donut have the same area. reply sinkwool 12 hours agorootparentBut they don&#x27;t have the same area. The donut seems to be at least 1.5x larger than the cup (check out the screenshots posted by latexr in another comment. The area covered by the donut is half that of the cup but it&#x27;s clearly less than half that of the donut, it looks more like a third or even a quarter of the donut) reply latexr 13 hours agorootparentprevI believe you, I don’t know. Show me different areas for both and maybe instinct will suggest something different. As it is, and because this was a game, I went for what seemed like a logic-y puzzle-y solution. reply V__ 17 hours agorootparentprevOh that is clever, I eyballed it from the left side, but your method makes logical sense. Just tried it and easily got it exactly. reply mhandley 17 hours agoparentprevWith the cup, I moved the doughnut up from below, and just eyeballed when the area above the midline of the cup equalled the area in the hole. Turns out I can do this fairly accurately. reply iamwil 16 hours agoparentprevI didn&#x27;t put much effort into it, and I got pretty close.

Are they counting pixels?Constructive solid geometry, and then some sort of computer graphics algorithm for area?Or is it an SVG, and they&#x27;re doing some sort of complex integral? (<--probably not) reply michaelkaufman 6 hours agoparentI had to check. It&#x27;s Next.js &#x2F;React and the images are all CSS using Chakra. Just looking at the payload, it&#x27;s sending the byte sizes which tells me they are counting bytes and checking for the difference. Pretty clever. reply dvh 16 hours agoparentprevThey are probably counting pixels but you could for example use destination-out compositing operation on canvas and resize to 1x1 pixel and read brightness of single pixel. reply salamanderman 16 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d guess SVG. It&#x27;s not a complex integral.

Whether this relates to support for Palestine or for Wikileaks has currently not been made clear. What follows is, unspun and unvarnished, my account of my interview under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act as given to my lawyers: I arrived from Keflavik airport, Iceland to Glasgow airport at about 10am on Monday 16 October. After passport control I was stopped by three police officers, two male and one female, who asked me to accompany them to a detention room. They seated me in the room and told me: I was detained under Section 7 of the Terrorism Act I was not arrested but detained, and therefore had no right to a lawyer. I had no right to remain silent. I had to give full and accurate information in response to questions. It was a criminal offence to withhold any relevant information. I had to give up any passwords to my devices. It was a criminal offence not to do this. They searched my baggage and my coat, going through my documents and taking my phone and laptop. They did not look at one document from Julian Assange’s lawyers that I told them was privileged. They asked me about boarding cards for Brussels and Dublin they found and what I had been doing there. I replied I was at a debate at Trinity College in Dublin, while in Brussels I had attended a human rights meeting focused on the case of Julian Assange. They asked me to identify the individuals from some visiting cards I had from the Brussels meeting (one was a German MP). They asked me the purpose of my visit to Iceland. I told them that I was attending a coordinating meeting of the campaign to free Julian Assange. I said I had also attended a pro-Palestinian rally outside the Icelandic parliament, but that had not been a prior intention. They asked how I earnt my living. I said from two sources: voluntary subscriptions to my blog, and my civil service pension. They asked what organisations I am a member of. I said the Alba party. I said I worked with Wikileaks and the Don’t Extradite Assange campaign, but was not formally a “member” of either. I was a life member of the FDA union. No other organisations. They asked if I received any money from Wikileaks, from Don’t Extradite Assange or from the Assange family (separate questions). I replied no, except occasional travel expenses from Don’t Extradite Assange. In December I had done a tour of Germany and received a fee from the Wau Holland Foundation, a German free speech charity. They asked what other campaigns I had been involved in. I said many, from the Anti-Nazi League and Anti-Apartheid movement on. I had campaigned for Guantanamo inmates alongside Caged Prisoners. They asked why I had attended the pro-Palestine demo in Iceland. I said one of the speakers had invited me, Ögmundur Jónasson. He was a former Icelandic Interior Minister. I said I did not know what the speeches said as they were all in Icelandic. They asked whether I intended to attend any pro-Palestinian rallies in the UK. I said I had no plans but probably would. They asked how I judged whether to speak alongside others on the same platform. I replied I depended on organisers I trusted, like the Palestine Solidarity Committee or Stop the War. It was impossible to know who everyone was at a big rally. They asked if anyone else posted to my twitter or blog. I replied no, it was all me. They asked how considered my tweets were. I replied that those which were links to my blog posts were my considered writing. Others were more ephemeral, and like everyone else I sometimes made mistakes and sometimes apologised. They asked if I deleted tweets and I said very seldom. I volunteered that I thought I understood the tweet that worried them and agreed it could have been more nuanced. This was the limitation of twitter. It was intended to refer only to the current situation within Gaza and the Palestinian people’s right of self-defence from genocide. That was more or less it. The interview was kept to exactly an hour and at one point one said to another “18 minutes left”. They did not tell me why. At one point they did mention protected journalistic material on my laptop but I was too dazed to take advantage of this and specify anything. They took my bank account details and copies of all my bank cards. ENDS This is an enormous abuse of human rights. The abuse of process in refusing both a lawyer and the right to remain silent, the inquiry into perfectly legal campaigning which is in no way terrorism-associated, the political questioning, the financial snooping and the seizure of material related to my private life, were all based on an utterly fake claim that I am associated with terrorism. I have to date not been arrested and not charged. Contempt of court is therefore not in play and you are free to comment on the case (although in the current atmosphere any kind of free thought is liable to vicious state action). I am safe and currently in Dublin. I intend next to travel to Switzerland to take this up with the United Nations. My legal team have already made a submission against this outrage to the United Nations Human Rights Committee and are looking at the possibility of judicial review in the UK. We also have to prepare the defence against possible terrorism charges, ludicrous as that sounds. I am afraid this all costs money. I am grateful for the unfailing generosity of people in what seems a continual history of persecution.

It was a criminal offence not to do this.This is what I find so terrifying about the terrorism act. I cannot understand how this is legal. The right to silence and privacy should be a human right. reply diggan 22 hours agoparentYeah, it seems to be a very over-reaching law, as far as I can gather. From https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...> Who can be examined?> The examining officer may only stop and question a person for the purpose of allowing a determination of whether that person appears to be someone who is or who has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of “terrorism” as defined in section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000I guess that makes sense... But then in the end of the same paragraph:> An examining officer may stop and question a person whether or not there are grounds for suspecting that the person is or has been concerned in terrorism.So, essentially anyone can be examined for any reason (or no reason at all)? reply londons_explore 22 hours agorootparentThey may stop and question anybody. But they cannot stop and question people for the purpose of, for example, recovering stolen goods.Basically, the officer must currently be working on a terrorism case to be able to use these powers. reply njharman 7 hours agorootparentStep one; get overreaching, extreme powers passed into law because they&#x27;ll only be used to fight \"terrorism\".Step two; redefine everything as terrorism. reply tremon 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd how is the detained going to ascertain that the officer really is working on a terrorism case and not conducting their own fishing expedition? Given that no lawyer may be present, I&#x27;m also sure that the target of the investigation is not to be disclosed to the victim. reply lesuorac 21 hours agorootparentprevStolen goods can&#x27;t be used for terrorism?I mean how am I supposed to know if you don&#x27;t intend to use that banana you didn&#x27;t pay for as part of a phalic terrorism display without getting access to your text messages? reply greggsy 21 hours agorootparentYou’re deliberately ignoring an honest explanation. reply mecsred 8 hours agorootparentNo, they&#x27;re pointing out the ways that explanation is dishonest. You cannot look at the political landscape and tell anyone in good conscience that officials will use an honest interpretation of the law. reply RHSeeger 21 hours agorootparentprevBut does the answer actually say what the law states, or does the law state what the (ignoring) response is describing. What was intended by a law and what the law actually says can vary wildly; and calling that out, when the law gives far greater power than it was intended to, is both reasonable and important. reply bombcar 21 hours agorootparentThe law says you just have to say the magic words, then you get full power. If you slip up and admit you were doing it for another reason, you might get a slap on the wrist. reply atoav 3 hours agorootparentprevWith every law that is as... vague.. as this, I always ask myself one question: \"If the Nazis would rise to power, how badly could they abuse it by doing only slight changes to how it&#x27;s interpreted?\"Here the answer is: Pretty badYour laws don&#x27;t have to survive a well meaning democratic government. They have to survive one that is cunning, evil and tries to actively abolish the Rule of Law and democracy.This is a bad law. reply AnimalMuppet 21 hours agorootparentprevYou are correct. But in historical practice, we see that laws get misused. Powers, however legitimate, get abused. Restrictions gets stretched, and then stretched to the breaking point, and then obliterated.So, while they deliberately ignored an honest explanation, they also had a legitimate point. replyrmbyrro 21 hours agoparentprevGovernments took advantage of the extreme fear created after the 9&#x2F;11 attacks to pass these absurd laws.I don&#x27;t think we can call them \"laws\", because are clearly against the most fundamental values of any democracy.No country is free anymore. Not even the US, which enjoys bolstering itself as \"the free world\".Any freedom you enjoy in a democratic state nowadays is merely circumstantial and can disappear instantly at any moment. reply jkaplowitz 9 hours agorootparentI agree with you in general, but regarding this specific phrase in this specific context:> Governments took advantage of the extreme fear created after the 9&#x2F;11 attacks to pass these absurd laws.Unless I misunderstand the legislative history, the law that was used here (Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000) dates from July 2000, so before 9&#x2F;11.Still part of the same trend as what happened after 9&#x2F;11, of course, but we shouldn’t pretend 9&#x2F;11 was the beginning of this, especially not in the UK. reply fragmede 7 hours agorootparent> especially not in the UK.For US readers who weren&#x27;t taught this in history class, the UK suffered a number of terrorist attacks by the IRA from the 1970&#x27;s til roughly 2001.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-britain-security-bombings... reply mikrotikker 8 hours agorootparentprevYes they took legislation Joe Biden wrote and tweaked it a little which is why they came up with the patriot Act so quickly following the attacks. reply anigbrowl 7 hours agorootparentNot everything in the world revolves around the USA. The UK had an ongoing terrorism problem in Northern Ireland, and had instituted plenty of draconian laws of its own pursuant to that, even before Biden became a Senator in 1972. reply 3seashells 3 hours agorootparentThe terrorism history is not much more than a pretext though. The source of these draconian Laws are highly stratified societies, with inept elites for seeing troubled times and accidentally accelerating them. reply Cthulhu_ 20 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;re not laws, they&#x27;re the exemption of laws, just like outlaws - \"a person declared as outside the protection of the law\". Terrorist means you&#x27;re not protected by the law, do not get rights, don&#x27;t fall under the Geneva Convention as a prisoner of war, etc. It means you get to go to Guantanamo Bay and rot for two decades without charge or anything.But it&#x27;s fine because it&#x27;s the most powerful country in the world that does it. If anyone objects, they get dropped. If it comes to a vote in e.g. the UN security councel, they use their veto power. reply herbst 1 hour agorootparentprev> No country is free anymore. Not even the US, which enjoys bolstering itself as \"the free world\".Especially the US. My government has no rights to do anything like that. Please don&#x27;t project your non freedom to the world. reply boppo1 5 hours agorootparentprev>No country is free anymore.I was just thinking about this, imagining being indefinitely detained for terrorism because 4chan is in my browser history[0]. I&#x27;d take the fifth, and they would charge me with a crime, and so, the US Constitution is basically void.But then I wondered: was it ever really not? Was there ever a time I could have relied on legal justice if I happen to be in an unsympathetic jurisdiction? Before there was an unconstitutional terrorism act, there would still probably have been DAs willing to look the other way on a police beating and willing to add bogus criminal charges because I&#x27;m uncooperative.Has justice ever been reliable? Right now it seems like maybe it has always been a psychological blanket.[0]hyperbolic obviously. Hopefully. Just a thought experiment, as that&#x27;s the only&#x2F;closest activity of mine that could be construed as terrorism. reply coolThingsFirst 1 hour agorootparentWhy is 4chan so dangerous?

It&#x27;s there for long time. And it could end your freedom any time if your are not encyclopedia of all current laws, regulations and restrictions of country where you live. reply bratbag 3 hours agorootparentprevThat was always the case. Otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t be in this situation now.Rights are arbitrary limits made up by people which can be changed or eliminated by people. Nothing more, nothing less. reply soco 20 hours agorootparentprevBasically agreeing with you, I want only to add that I don&#x27;t believe it was freer earlier - just people less informed. reply mikrotikker 8 hours agorootparentFISA and the patriot Act and NSLs did not increase the freedom did they? reply ornornor 3 hours agoparentprevThe UK is the epitome of a surveillance society. It’s very creepy. Cctv everywhere, no right to silence or counsel because terrorism… it’s a surveillance state. reply t0lo 2 hours agoparentprevIs there any &#x27;legal&#x27; way to get around sharing a password if asked to?I&#x27;m thinking either a rotating password that you learn only when you need to access a device&#x2F;file that is on a separate device that you store somewhere else.Or we take a leaf out of nuclear launch keys and two people have part of the password- if any of this is remotely different- obligatory IANAL reply SturgeonsLaw 29 minutes agorootparentThey&#x27;ll just imprison you until you unlock the device (or for up to 5 years, if you&#x27;d prefer to just wait it out) reply cataphract 7 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s why the UK has had losses related with this acts in the European Court of Human Rights.

In a situation like this many people would feel ill. If you are ill an interview is not reasonable to answer questions. If you are ill you should see a doctor.

The examining officer must explain their role to the person and that Schedule 7 is a part of counter-terrorism policing at the port&#x2F;UK border, but that this does not mean that they are suspected of being involved in terrorism. The purpose of the examination is to determine whether the person appears to be someone who is or who has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. If requested, the examining officer must provide sufficient information, such as an identification number and location, to the person or his or her representative to enable the officer to be identified in the event of any query or complaint.35. The examining officer will explain how the examination will be conducted and must offer a Schedule 7 Public Information Leaflet. The Public Information Leaflet is available in multiple languages, and outlines the purpose and provisions of Schedule 7, duties under Schedule 7, key points of the code of practice, including an individual’s rights, and relevant contact details (including those needed to provide feedback or make a complaint).39. Where an officer decides it is necessary to examine a person for longer than an hour, then questioning under paragraph 2 and 3 of Schedule 7 may only continue beyond the hour point if the person has been detained under paragraph 6 of Schedule 7. Any period of examination, including detention, must not exceed six hours from the commencement of the examination. reply breakpointalpha 17 hours agorootparentLast sentence of section 39 makes it look like all you have to do is remain silent for 6 hours to be released. I&#x27;m not a lawyer. reply lucubratory 1 hour agorootparentRefusing to answer the questions is a crime. Once you&#x27;ve committed a crime, the examination part can give way to the \"You&#x27;re under arrest\" part. reply midasuni 2 hours agorootparentprevNor would you be allowed a lawyer reply londons_explore 22 hours agorootparentprev> He didn&#x27;t have to answer questions or give them passwordsSection 49 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 requires that if you know the information required and refuse to provide it, you can be sentenced to a maximum of 2 years imprisonment.However, the notice must be given properly in writing.So, while these officers perhaps were deceitful in asking verbally for passwords rather than giving a written notice, the meaning of what they were saying was still correct - there is a legal requirement to hand over passwords. reply denton-scratch 21 hours agorootparent> you can be sentenced to a maximum of 2 years imprisonmentYeah, but that involves a charge, and you get a lawyer.I would have refused to answer anything without first consulting a lawyer; I won&#x27;t take legal advice from the investigating policeman. \"You say I have to answer? Fine, I&#x27;ll answer if my lawyer confirms that.\" What can go wrong? The worst that can happen is that they charge you (with something?) for refusing to answer. Voila: legal advice.I guess Craig&#x27;s devices didn&#x27;t have much of interest on them; he travels a lot, and has been mauled by the law more than once. So he can give up the passwords with confidence. And presumably they already knew what meetings he&#x27;d attended, with whom. reply Cthulhu_ 20 hours agorootparentYeah but, you refuse to give the information, so that&#x27;s a crime; even with a lawyer you&#x27;re then liable for a maximum of two years imprisonment.That&#x27;s the fucker about these laws; in a lot of constitutions (note that the UK does not have a constitution so I&#x27;m not sure how it works over there), you have the right to not provide evidence that may lead to your conviction. But rules like this go counter to those. reply enasterosophes 8 hours agorootparentMaximum of two years, in practice means you&#x27;ll be out in a few months on probation. You&#x27;ll keep most of your life and get a story to tell for the rest of it.Worth calling their bluff, I reckon. reply remram 8 hours agorootparentMonths in prison is worth what now?You&#x27;re gonna leave your family, lose your job, have to explain to everybody you know that you were in jail for a while. For a good story? reply autoexec 8 hours agorootparentFor most people in the US, being in jail, even if only for a couple months would mean losing their home too. reply enasterosophes 7 hours agorootparentprevPossible months, for a new experience, and perhaps the consequences aren&#x27;t so catastrophic. Lots of people go to jail and live long and happy lives afterwards.Don&#x27;t live in fear, that is not worth it. reply southernplaces7 4 hours agorootparentYou do understand that in many places (and certainly in the U.S.) a criminal conviction, even a minor one, can mean the crushing destruction of your professional career, job prospects and all sorts of future opportunities. It&#x27;s a shit show of a discriminatory system that keeps this alive but it&#x27;s what it is and very real.For millions of people it would be a disaster that you don&#x27;t just smile your way out of with some optimism and a laughingly good story. It&#x27;s not just about \"don&#x27;t live in fear\", Instead it&#x27;s often a harshly practical matter of \"oh shit, i&#x27;m going to jail for months, the bank will foreclose on my home, my job will fire me and my kids are fucked\".... You might be okay with that, but it&#x27;s no fucking joke for many, no matter how lightly they try to take the burden. replyfullarr 22 hours agorootparentprevYes and if you force them to prosecute, only then can you take it to an appeals court to strike down an unconstitutional lawThe system sucks but this is how it works reply autoexec 8 hours agorootparentFar more likely that you&#x27;d just bankrupt your family, lose your home and your job, only to have the courts uphold that same unconstitutional law. I&#x27;d respect the hell of anyone who tried and sacrificed everything they had to force the courts to confirm that the constitution is being ignored to satisfy an oppressive and power hungry government, but I sure as hell wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or be able&#x2F;willing to myself. reply kypro 22 hours agorootparentprevHow does this work? If they have to provide writing what&#x27;s the point? Surely the individual could just wipe their device in that time?If they confiscate the device during the initial detention then them issuing written notice that they need the password doesn&#x27;t really change much since they&#x27;re going to be getting access to your device whether you like it or not. reply coldtea 21 hours agorootparent>Surely the individual could just wipe their device in that time?And then they charge them with obstruction of justice and destruction of potential evidence. reply _visgean 22 hours agorootparentprevHe was detained in a room.

If it&#x27;s \"because I was waiting for my lawyer to arrive, and then I answered the question just fine\", I&#x27;m not sure a court could rightly draw an adverse inference there.The \"we can infer guilt\" seems to be more because there&#x27;s a bunch of corner cases where an absolute right to silence CAN have kind of stupid outcomes. Many countries choose to accept those outcomes because they don&#x27;t want to convict the innocent.

I was curious how many far right, non-Islamic organisations are listed as proscribed organisations so I counted them:* Atomwaffen Division (AWD)* Feuerkrieg Division (FKD)* Sonnenkrieg Division (SKD)* National Action* The BaseOut of all these, I’d only heard of National Action.It’s not clear (to me) that all the proscribed groups are actually active in the UK though, with the Internet, I guess they can be recruiting people to their cause.I also wasn’t too surprised to see that the most recent addition to the list is the Wagner Group (proscribed in September 2023).On the other hand, I was surprised to see that Basque separatists, ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna) are still listed – despite the fact that they renounced the armed struggle over a decade ago and dissolved their organisation five years ago.Curiously, their “List of proscribed groups linked to Northern Ireland related terrorism” is even more out-of-date. Since the second-wave of feminism, Cumann na mBan is essentially an historical relic. Some of the organisations (e.g. Saor Éire) haven’t been active since the 70s. The IPLO were (violently) eliminated in the early 90s. The Irish Republican Army is listed but there’s no distinction made between the multiple different groups that refer to themselves as the “Irish Republican Army”; the largest of these (by far), the Provisional IRA abandoned the armed struggle two decades ago and committed themselves to constitutional means of achieving their political aims (as per the 1998 Belfast Agreement aka the Good Friday Agreement) – though splinter IRAs remain opposed to the Peace Process. reply kridsdale3 7 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t \"The Base\" == Al Qaeda? reply anigbrowl 6 hours agorootparentNo, although the name was likely picked to cause exactly such confusion. &#x27;Al Qaeda&#x27; is commonly translated as &#x27;the base&#x27; but there&#x27;s no connection between the two.

People above a certain station can trivially tell what is the establishment political winds, short and long term, and which are the \"annoying\" people that go against them.

They can and do build organizational \"vendettas\" and keep tabs, harass, prosecute them, for years, or even decades.This goes all the way.

That charge was prosecuted before a single judge, who was very much a member of \"The Establishment\", and he got 6 months in the slammer.It&#x27;s still not clear which remarks he made on his blog that contributed to jigsaw identification. Maybe it was a commenter on his blog that made the troublesome remark.

Iran does (though not Arab), but they provide them with weapons.Before the attack, Israel was issuing work permits to Gazans to let them work and earn badly-needed money in Israel; so much for that.I can see why Israel doesn&#x27;t want Gazans participating in normal life there: they keep shooting rockets at them.

Considering the Arabs have never agreed to the partition plan of 1948 it is well within Israel right to contest this area and the common definition of \"occupied territories\" is not that clear cut considering no country owned it before 1967.The settlements themselves don&#x27;t displace any Arabs from their home, they were built either on Jewish land (Jews lived in Judea and Samaria until 1948) or on a land which didn&#x27;t have a specific ownership. Usually if an Arab can show that they have ownership for a parcel of land they will get it in court.In any case, Gaza is not occupied and except from the hostages there are no Jews in Gaza.

Or why ads, sue the media companies that publish them. Or maybe vendors that sell the magazines, or all of them - since they make up a platform like Facebook. \"Majority of their time on social media\" is not a harm. The rest are similar and&#x2F;or not clearly linked to anything.Really this lawsuit is just a meta for safety-ist culture that probably causes mental health issues in the first place.It&#x27;s like I spent hours per day playing soccer when I was a kid, and regularly got injured, broke my leg once. I got bullied there too on occasion, by some definition. Oh, and we used to play games where the losing team would bend over at the goal line and the winning team would try to kick the ball as hard as possible at their asses (or legs) from like 15ft - I dunno if this is bullying (I&#x27;ve done a lot of both bending and kicking), but I&#x27;m pretty sure someone has to think of the children...So I guess the parents (or no, not parents - states!) shoulda sued the town that provided us with a public soccer field, cause \"harms\" happened there :)EDIT: come think of it, unlike other cases - parents cannot control the other kids&#x27; behavior in school or out in the neighborhood - preventing their own children from using social media is comparatively trivial. So, there&#x27;s also that - I guess if facebook is responsible for harms, all of the parents affected should be sued for neglect :) reply johnnyanmac 4 hours agorootparent>Ok, so you should be able to sue schools where regular bullying happens, or ads that supposedly promote unrealistic beauty standards for eating disorders, righIf they 1) know of such bullies and 2) do nothing or even enable it, yes.

I&#x27;m not sure if there are any laws against that (the national enquirer is still on my grocery store checkout line after all), so I&#x27;m guessing freedom of press overrides that.

Since Libel laws are very strong in the US).>Majority of their time on social media\" is not a harm. The rest are similar and&#x2F;or not clearly linked to anything.Not by itself no.

Personally, I&#x27;m very much glad that the government doesn&#x27;t allow companies to sell food to children with ground up glass in it no matter what individual parents do or don&#x27;t allow and nothing about that ban on ground up glass in food means that we should also ban soda or candy.We can absolutely look at products and services that are actually harmful and deem them unacceptable for children without banning every other thing on the planet that might possibly be bad. Some states feel that Facebook has risen to the level where it&#x27;s harmful enough to do something at the government level.

If you constantly bombard someone with a drip feed of negative emotions.. that probably does them harm.This doesn&#x27;t mean the litigants will prevail because correlation and causation aren&#x27;t 1:1 but it&#x27;s probably a good idea to push your kid away from social media by explaining this to them. reply micromacrofoot 17 hours agoprevThe FTC is looking to hire child psychologists to evaluate the affects of these platforms, so expect more of this to comehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;23&#x2F;ftc-plans-to-hire-child-psyc...There&#x27;s a thin line to be walked between privacy and regulation, but Facebook&#x27;s own research has pointed at the harmful effects of Instagram on the mental health of children... so I think some scrutiny here is overdue.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;6&#x2F;22712927&#x2F;facebook-instagr... reply bertil 17 hours agoparent> Facebook&#x27;s own research has pointed at the harmful effects of Instagram on the mental health of childrenFacebook’s own research has found both positive and negative effects, depending on the child’s status among their peers.The Verge is quick to point out that:> Instagram makes teen girls feel worse about their bodiesbut more discreet in reminding people that fashion magazines, including The Cut (also published by Vox), have the same negative effects and none of the positive ones, like helping gender minority find a safe space, re-socialising people with physical handicaps or anxiety. The critique makes sense —I’m not denying it— but it doesn’t come. from “the algorithm.” It comes from having a lot of money poured into the Instagram creation ecosystem. Instagram has very little control over that as most of it is through brand deals or magazine raising their own profile. That behemoth of money and attention comes from an industry that has decades of well-documented problematic practices behind it, including the unrepentant glorification of using self-starvation and drugs, notably cocaine, to reach unhealthy thinness.If you condemn Instagram but don’t include that industry among the culprits, you’ll have Snap with unhealthy models, TikTok with unhealthy models, or whatever comes next with unhealthy models. reply ad404b8a372f2b9 16 hours agorootparentHow does Instagram re-socialise people with physical handicaps? reply gabeio 16 hours agorootparentAllowing them to find friends which have similar positions&#x2F;situations who understand what they live with. reply ad404b8a372f2b9 15 hours agorootparentHmm that&#x27;s any piece of connected software on the internet though.

Having worldwide interest groups (like subreddits, like thematic Discord channels) helps, but is conditioned to people using either Reddit or Discord. Facebook and Instagram still win compared to those two contenders.That’s of course assuming that Reddit and Discord wouldn’t get much bigger if Meta were to close, but I’m not sure the negative effects would vanish because the owner is different. reply micromacrofoot 14 hours agorootparentprevis it safe to assume that you&#x27;ve worked at meta at some point? because this comes across as a little defensiveThe post is about instagram so I&#x27;m talking about instagram, feel free to post an article about magazines if you want to talk about magazines... legislation aimed towards instagram will create precedence to pursue other platforms like tiktok and can also become ingrained as policy. Just because we&#x27;re focusing on one subject here doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re ignoring the others or playing favorites. reply bertil 13 hours agorootparentThe post isn’t about Instagram at the exclusion of the fashion ecosystem: it’s an argument that truncates research that does find that posts that the drop in self-esteem is directly related to seeing posts either from fashion professionals or peers trying to emulate those. You can’t read those studies and think that detail is not part of the key findings.Those are not two similar but separate problems.This is like saying that mail bombs are the problem of the post office and not people having access to explosives: the problem isn’t envelopes. It’s people with access to explosives, and FedEx would likely have the same issue—unless federal rules allow them to scan and to refuse to deliver explosives.I’m not being crass with a bad metaphor: focusing on the support has been a key issue in the argument for a while. Fashion magazines used to be decried as “glossy paper,” but no one thought the difference between magazines sending problematic self-image and serious news was that newspapers came on broad sheets of mate paper. Still, it’s now how the problem is presented: without clear separation.I did work at Meta on the team looking at Teenagers, and I did raise that point internally: should we look at gambling and alcohol and extend the same rules to fashion? Should we boost peers over brands to avoid problematic ideation?Those conversations, without the shadow of fashion partners, were generally productive. It wasn’t perfect: the goal remained “engagement” but there were no sacred cows to avoid.As soon as the findings about teenage body dysmorphia were put in the context of fashion (and presented to one particular executive who cared about advertising more than algorithmic boost), that question was buried. Several friends of mine got blackballed hard not for suggesting Instagram-specific treatment, but for instance, for asking Anna Wintour about the quip where she fat-shamed her best friend in _The September Issue_ (it’s a niche fashion reference, but it’s widely considered a smoking gun in the industry).There are inherent biases to how Instagram and Facebook work: you post when you achieve something, and there’s a bias towards success, but the internal findings rarely found that those were crippling. Thinness, on the other hand, leads to clear, widespread medical issues. I remember asking if the issue became more prevalent because teenagers didn’t have access to that many magazines before but that the dose effect was comparable. I don’t think anyone has looked into that.I’m not saying that to disengage Meta’s responsibility: I had argued for explicit filters, like giving teenage boys who know they can’t resist and will behave in a way they think is unhealthy, the ability to exclude scantly clad women in their feed. I used another example, naturally (more typical of internal debate). That idea could have had legs ten years ago; now, with the debate being a lot less constructive, I&#x27;m not sure. reply micromacrofoot 12 hours agorootparentthe post office did actually implement stricter screening, including x-rays, chemical detection, and GPS tracking, due to mail bombs... in a way mail bombs sped up the process of implementing package tracking systems for everyone — they took a very serious approach to safety despite not being the direct cause of the problemfrom my perspective, this is the kind of regulation the FTC should seek out — so for different reasons I agree with your analogymagazines are an entirely different beast and it&#x27;s strange to not address that — I have to physically go out of my way to purchase a magazine or have one delivered... that&#x27;s something I opt in topeople opt-in to instagram, but for teenagers there are much larger stakes involved... instagram has become an integral part of many teens&#x27; social life (by design) and they&#x27;re constantly getting targeted and personalized ads fed to them directlythe fact that the goal remains engagement makes it pretty clear where meta&#x27;s priorities lie, and it&#x27;s not on the side of safety reply happytiger 16 hours agorootparentprevI’m good with damming them all and getting rid of shit technology directions that hurt people, especially kids.Who is actually ok with this? reply dylan604 16 hours agorootparentThe people making money from it; either the company itself or the employees working for it that are designing it.

It&#x27;s entirely possible to host communities that aren&#x27;t corrupted by investors who want 1000x returns on their investments.However, the Utah law defines social media as any online forum belonging to a site with more than 5m users that allows people to register accounts and interact with others[1]:> (9) \"Social media company\" means a person or entity that:> (a) provides a social media platform that has at least 5,000,000 account holders worldwide; and> (b) is an interactive computer service.> (10)(a) \"Social media platform\" means an online forum that a social media company makes available for an account holder to:> (i) create a profile;> (ii) upload posts;> (iii) view the posts of other account holders; and> (iv) interact with other account holders or users.The law uses broad strokes to ban much more than just social media, it bans any group or community that might belong to a parent site that has a moderately-sized user base.In effect, the law isolates anyone under 18 who might want to find community outside of their potentially abusive or extremist parents.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;le.utah.gov&#x2F;xcode&#x2F;Title13&#x2F;Chapter63&#x2F;13-63-S101.html?... reply huytersd 6 hours agorootparentI’m personally okay with that, if you want help you can find resources in other adults and organizations in your life.

The billionaires aren’t blocking us. Yes, it’s unfair that they hold so much wealth and power. The world has been that way for a long time.When electric lightbulbs came to the masses, it made some rich people even richer, but that’s not the important part. The important part is that the masses’ lives were better.Next steps for us:- Find manufacturing processes that don’t require overseas slave labour- Agricultural processes that don’t need as much pesticide- Better, cheaper medicine (recent developments in quantum computing suggest we may be able to crack protein folding within 10 years, which will lead to an explosion in medical research)- Automated construction (see Hadrian X)- A replacement for fossil fuels (if we crack fusion, we can use that for the grid and we can create our own combustion juice for vehicles using the enormous amount of energy available)- Protocells that allow extremely precise manufacturing at scale (protocells are programmed cells or completely custom cells that we can equip & program for certain tasks, like “remove all the iron ore from the ground here” — they will change everything)These are the things that will bring the rest of the world out of poverty.

I agree tech is the driver of the positive sum games we call the economy, but it&#x27;s important to note that on top of technology we need a political apparatus that allocates the efficiency gain. Ie a 30% increase in productivity should yield not a 30% increase in profits but maybe a 5% increase and a 25% reduction of time spent doing labor or 25% increase in wages. Obviously the numbers are variable, but I thought it important to note this too.>The billionaires aren’t blocking us.People hoarding more wealth than BILLIONS combined aren&#x27;t blocking us?You can seriously, earnestly think, in your heart of hearts, that hoarding that much wealth for yourself doesn&#x27;t deprive some other more worthy endeavor of resources??>When electric lightbulbs came to the masses, it made some rich people even richer, but that’s not the important part.Not THE important part, I can agree with you. But AN important part, still. It might not be sensible to accost the inventor of the light bulb for the effect of his invention, but it should always be carefully noted the above mentioned calculation of where the efficiency gain is allocated. Did allowance of working at night, doubling the possible working hours allow any reduction of labor or increase in wages? Or did it simply increase profit?I agree the profit itself is not the problem, the billionaires themselves aren&#x27;t technically the problem, merely a symptom of an ill designed allocation of the fruits of technology. But to act like 9 people hoarding more than billions of people combined isn&#x27;t detrimental to any goal other than the enrichment of those 9? I name you silly, sir.>Taxing billionaires won’t accelerate any of this.I mean, if we JUST tax them and then burn the tax money we get from them, sure...

Maybe call it the dosage fallacy?Yes, bullying has always been a problem. Yes, society has always been force-feeding kids dangerously unattainable body images. The problem is not that these things have just been repackaged into a different kind of book or TV show. The problem is that it takes much less effort than any time in history to fake a \"community\" all parroting the same dangerous lie.The old adage went \"If I run into one asshole today, then I ran into an asshole. If I run into 100 assholes today, then I am the asshole, and I should reflect\", and it was pretty good advice. But if one asshole can create the illusion that you ran into 100 of them, what&#x27;s the appropriate response. The whole problem with facebook and instagram is that it has made coordinating bullying campaigns much MUCH cheaper from a labor standpoint. Couple that with the constant drive to keep kids on the platform and you have a system that seems purpose built to drive already anxious kids to suicide.I can 100% keep my kids off social media.

Just because they’re online, I don’t abdicate my responsibility as their guardian, but companies think it’s a good idea to allow kids to bypass the restrictions that were in place because they’ve reached an age that was meant as a minimal age for tracking in a very young Internet.Unfortunately for our kids, we’ve become extremely restrictive to the service they have access to, they can only use platforms that allow communicating with people we know, etc. Is that the right move? For us, right now, it seems to be. reply dragonwriter 9 hours agorootparent> As a parent of a now-13 year old, I’m disappointed that COPPA hasn’t been updated after companies have gone aggressively after children.COPPA was the culmination of a series of progressively more narrow attempts to restrict internet content and practices using “think of the children” as a justification, the previous efforts were, but for some standalone bits (like Section 230, which survived from the mostly-unconstitutional Communications Decency Act) struck down as unconstitutional, which is why there haven&#x27;t been attempts to update it with more broadly applicable restrictions—its already the outcome of a process of backing off to the maximal constitutional restriction (OTOH, with a socially conservative Supreme Court that is unusually unconcerned with respecting precedent, I suppose now would be the time, if you wanted to do that.) reply jonhohle 8 hours agorootparentThere is historical precedent for limiting access for children. Children can&#x27;t legally buy cigarettes, alcohol, lottery tickets, firearms (of which owning is a constitutional right), or enter certain prohibited places. Unfortunately, I many service providers have abused their access to children and acted as if children can legally enter into some type of one sided quasi-contract. The bar for working with children at any physical location is huge and boundaries are well understood.I know of exactly zero places I take my children (activities, sports, clubs, etc.) that would speak to them privately to coerce them to use that service more without parental consent.

More likely, they may have imagined the web as a whole would grow (scale) as more people gained internet access.This, I think, is roughly true but the issue is nuanced. The history of the web can be characterized by ever-decreasing barriers to entry. At first you needed a physical host and apache. Then, you could have a shared host and put html files in your user directory. Then, you could run wordpress. Then, you could sign up for myspace and never have to run anything. The &#x27;like&#x27; is the smallest unit of content that can be captured by such systems. TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, wikipedia, etc are what you get from this evolution.The unexpected downside is that with reduced friction to content-creation, the content has become quite awful. In part because people are awful, but also because of money and how effective it is to hire people to say things using these systems. If the friction to create content remained high, it may have been a \"better\" internet in some measures. It would certainly be a much smaller one.Who knows how it will turn out?

That Time the City of Seattle Accidentally Gave Me 32m Emails for 40 Dollars October 19, 2018 — Matt Chapman Background In my last post, I wrote about my adventure of requesting metadata for both phone calls and emails from the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor. The work there - and its associated frustration - sent me down a path of sending requests throughout the US to both learn whether these sorts of problems are systemic (megaspoiler: they are) and to also start mapping communication across the United States. Since then, I’ve submitted over a hundred requests for email metadata across the United States – at least two per state. The first large batch of requests for email metadata were sent to the largest cities of fourteen arbitrary states in a trial run of sorts. In the end of that batch, only two cities were willing to continue with the request - Houston and Seattle. Houston complied surprisingly quickly and snail mailed the metadata for 6m emails. Seattle on the other hand... The Request On April 2, 2017 I sent this fairly boilerplate request to Seattle's IT department: For all emails sent to/from any Seattle owned email address in 2017, please provide the following information: 1. From address 2. To address 3. bcc addresses 4. cc addresses 5. Time 6. Date Technically this request can done with a single line powershell command. At a policy level, though, it usually gets a lot of pushback. Seattle's first response included a bit of gobsmackery that I’ve almost become used to: Based on my preliminary research, there have been 5.5 million emails sent and 26.8 million emails received by seattle.gov email addresses in the past 90 days. This is a significant amount of records that will need to be reviewed prior to sharing them with you. Do you have a more targeted list of email addresses you might be interested in? If not, I will work to find out how long review will take and will be in touch. Of course, I still want the records, so - I would like to stick with this request as-is for all ~32m emails. Since this request is for metadata only, the amount of review needed should be relatively small. Fee Estimate of 33 Million Dollars A week later, I received this glorious response. Each paragraph is interesting in itself, so let’s break most of it down piece by piece. Rewording of request This acknowledges receipt of your public disclosure request C012032-041017 received on April 03, 2017 regarding: All emails sent to/from any Seattle owned email address in 2017 including metadata:1. From address2. To address3. bcc addresses4. cc addresses5. Time6. Date Notice the change of language from the original wording. Their rewording completely changes the scope of the request so that it's not just for metadata, but also the emails contents. No idea why they did that. Salary Fees With that being said, Seattle IT estimates spending 30 seconds to two minutes to review each email. It has been estimated that this work will take approximately 320 years of staff time at an expense of $33 million in salary. Wot. Normally, a flustered public records officer would just reject a giant request for being for “unduly burdensome”… but this sort of estimate is practically unheard of. So much so that other FOIA nerds have told me that this is the second biggest request they've ever seen. The passive aggression is thick. Needless to say, it's not something I'm willing to pay for! The estimate of 30s per metadata entry is also a bit suspect. Especially with the use of Excel, which would be useful for removing duplicates, etc. Storage Fees We estimate that this request contains 8-10 terabytes of information, for which we could need to stand up an FTP server through which the requester will be able to download cleared email meta data. As allowed under RCW 42.56.120, we would charge the requester for the actual copying costs of fulfilling this request. Based on the Seattle IT cost model used for internal City charge backs, the anticipated cost to the requester is $2,480 per year plus $2.11 per gigabyte of storage. We are still working on the storage requirements for this effort. If we assume 10 TB of storage, this would require $21,606.40/year in requester fees. Heh. Any sysadmin can tell you that The costs of storage doesn’t exactly come from the storage medium itself; administration costs, supporting hardware, etc, are the bulk of the costs. But come on, let’s be realistic here. There’s very little room for good faith in their cost estimates – especially since the last time a single gigabyte cost that much was between 2002 and 2004. That said – some other interesting things going on here: Their file size estimation is huge. For comparison, that Houston’s email metadata dump was only 1.2GB. The fact that they mention “meta data” [sic] implies that they did acknowledge that the request was for metadata. Seattle already uses Amazon S3 to store public records requests’ data. At the time, S3 was charging $.023/GB Continue anyway? At this time, the City anticipates that it will be able to provide a first installment of records on or about May 29, 2017. However, please note that this time estimate may change depending on the clarification you provide and as we continue to process your request. If the City does not hear from you within 30 days, the City will consider your request closed. Oddly, they don't actually close out the request and instead ask whether I wanted to continue or not. I responded to their amazing email by asking how many records I'd receive on May 29th, but never received an answer back. Reversal of the Original Cost Estimate On June 5, they sent a new response admitting that their initial fee estimation was wrong, and asked for $1.25 for two days’ (out of three months) of records: At this point I can send you an exel spreadsheet with the data points you are requesting. The cost for the first installment is $1.25 for emails sent or received on January 1 and 2, 2017. Because the spreadsheet does not contain the body of the email and just the metadata that you requested, no review will be necessary, and we'll be able to get this information to you at a faster pace than the 320 years quoted you earlier. Because they're asking for a single check for $1.25 for just two days’ worth of metadata – and wouldn’t send anything until that first check came in, my interpretation is that they’re taking a page from /r/maliciouscompliance and just making this request as painful as possible just for the simple sake of making it difficult. So in response, I preemptively sent them fourteen separate checks. The first thirteen checks were all around ~$1.25. That seemed to work, since they never asked for a single payment afterwards. From there, my inbox went mostly silent for two months, and I mostly forgot about the request, though they eventually cashed all of the checks and made me an account for their public records portal. SNAFU Fast forward to August 22, when I randomly added that email account back to my phone. Unexpectedly, it turned out they actually finished the request! And without a bill for millions of dollars! Sure enough, their public records request portal had about 400 files available to download, which all in all contained metadata for about 32 million emails. Neat! Problem though... they accidentally included the first 256 characters of all 32 million emails. Here are some things I found in the emails: Usernames and passwords. Credit card numbers. Social security numbers and drivers licenses. Ongoing police investigations and arrest reports. Texts of cheating husbands to their lovers. FBI Investigations. Zabbix alerts. In other words... they just leaked to me a massive dataset filled with intimately private information. In the process, they very likely broke many laws, including the Privacy Act of 1974 and many of WA's own public records laws. Frankly, I'm still at a loss of words. It’s hard to say how any of this happened exactly, but odds are that a combination of request’s rewording and the original public records officer going on vacation led to a communication breakdown. I don’t want to dwell on the mistake itself, so I’ll stop it at that. Side note to Seattle's IT department - clean up your disks. You shouldn't have that many disks at 100%! Raising the Issue I responded as passively as possible in the hopes that they’d catch their mistake on their own: The responsive records are not consistent with my request and includes much more info than I initially requested. Could you please revisit this request and provide the records responsive to my initial request? Their response: The information that you requestedis located in columns: From address = column J To address = column K bcc address = column M cc address = column L Time and date = column R of the reports. The records were generatedfrom a system report and I am unable to limit the report to generate only thefields you requested. The City has no duty to create a record that doesnot exist. As such, we have provided all records responsive to yourrequest and consider your request closed. Disregarding the fact that they used a very common tactic of denying information on the basis that its disclosure would require the creation of new records… they didn’t get the point. I explained what information they leaked, and made it very clear how I was going to escalate this: Please address this matter as if it was a large data breach. For now, I will be raising this matter to the WA Office of Privacy and Data Protection. None of the files provided to me have been shared with anyone else, nor do I have any future intention of sharing. Their response: Thank you for your email and bringing this inadvertent error to our attention so quickly. We have temporarily suspended access to GovQA while we look into the cause of this issue. We are also working on reprocessing your request and anticipate providing you with corrected copies of the records you requested through GovQA next week. In the meantime, please do not review, share, copy or otherwise use these records for any purpose. We are sorry for any inconvenience. Phone Call Not too long after that, after contacting some folks on Seattle’s Open Data Slack, I found my way onto a conference phone call with both Seattle’s Chief Technology officer and their Chief Privacy Officer and we discussed what happened, and what should happen with the records. They thanked me for bringing the situation to their attention and all that, but the mood of the call was as if both parties had a knife behind their back. Somewhere towards the end of the call, I asked them if it was okay to keep the emails. Why not at least ask, right? Funny enough, in the middle of that question, my internet died and interrupted the call for the first time in the six months I lived in that house. Odd. It came back ten minutes later, and I dialed back into the conference line, but the mood of the call pretty much 180’d. They told me: All files were to be deleted. Seattle would hire Kroll to scan my hard drives to prove deletion. Agreeing to #1 and #2 would give me full legal indemnification. This isn't something I'm even remotely cool with, so we ended the call a couple minutes later, and agreed to have our lawyers speak going forward. Deleting the Files After that call, I asked my lawyer to reach out to their lawyer and was pretty much told that Seattle was approaching the problem as if they were pursuing Computer Fraud And Abuse (CFAA) charges. For information that they sent. Jiminey Cricket.. So, I deleted the files. Most of what happened next over a month or so was mostly between their lawyer and mine, so there’s not really that much for me to say. Early on I suggested that I write an affidavit that explains what happened, how I deleted the files, and I validated that the files were deleted. They mostly agreed, but still wanted to throw some silly assurance things my way – including asking me to run a bash script to overwrite any unused disk space with random bits. I eventually ran zerofree and fstrim instead, and they accepted the affidavit. No more legal threats from there. Seattle’s Reaction About a week after the phone call, a Seattle city employee contacted Seattle’s KIRO7 about the incident. In KIRO7's investigation, they learned that, Seattle hadn’t sent any disclosure of the leak - something required by WA’s public records request law. Only after their investigation did Seattle actually notify its employees about the emails leak. Link to their story (video inside). A week later, another article was published by Seattle’s Crosscut which goes into a lot of detail, including some history of Seattle's IT department. This line towards the bottom still makes me laugh a little: The buffer against potential legal and administrative chaos in this scenario is only that Chapman has turned out to be, as Armbruster described him, a \"good Samaritan.\" Efforts to track down Chapman were not successful; Crosscut contacted several Matthew Chapmans who denied being the requester. On January 19th, Seattle's CTO, Michael Mattmiller gave his resignation. Whether his resignation is related to the email leak is hard to say, but I just think the timing makes it worth mentioning. Finally – The Metadata Starting January 26th, Seattle started sending installments of the email metadata I requested. So far they've sent 27 million emails. As of the writing of this post, there are only two departments who haven’t provided their email metadata: the Police Department and Human Services. You can download the raw data here. Some things about the dataset: It’s very messy – triple quotes, semicolons, commas, oh my. There are a millions of systems alerts. For seattle.gov → seattle.gov communication, there are two distinct metadata records. In any case, it's still somewhat workable, so I've been working on a proof of concept for its use in the greater context of public records laws. Not ready to talk much about it yet, so here's is a gephi graph of one day's worth of metadata. Its layout is Yifan Hu and filtered with a k-core minimum of 5 and a minimum degree of 5: Please reach out to me if you'd like to help model these networks. One Last Thing: Legislative Immunity Kerfuffle This last section might not be related, but the timing is interesting, so I feel it’s worth mentioning. On February 23 - between the first installment of email metadata and the second - WA’s legislature attempted to pass SB6617, a bill which removes requirements for disclosure of many of their records – including email exchanges - from WA’s public records laws. What’s particularly interesting about this events of this bill is that it took less than 24 hours from the time it was read for the first time to the time that it passed at both the House and Senate and sent to the Governor’s office. Seattle Times wrote a good article about it. Thankfully, after the WA governor’s office received over 6,300 phone calls, 100 letters, and over 12,500 emails, the governor ended up vetoing the bill. Neat. It's hard to say if that caused any sort of delay, but after a month and a half of waiting: How are the installments looking? I saw that there was some recent legislative immunity kerfuffle around emails. Is that related to any delays? And got this response: Good news. The recent Washington state legislative immunity kerfuffle will not impact your installments. We have fixed the bug that was impacting our progress and are now on our way. In fact, I'll have more records for you this week. A month later, they started sending the rest. What’s Next? The work done throughout this post has led to a massive trove of information that ought to be enormously useful in understanding the dynamics of one the US's biggest cities. A big hope in making this sort of information available to the public is that it will help in changing the dynamic of understanding what sorts of information is accessible. That said, this is just one city of many which have given me email metadata. As more of it comes through, I’ll be able to map out more and more, but the difficulty in requesting those records continues to get in the way. Once I get some of these bigger stories out of the way, I’ll start writing fewer stories and write more about public records requesting fundamentals – particularly for digital records. Next post will be about my ongoing suit against the White House OMB for email metadata from January 2017. This past Wednesday was the first court date - where the defendent's counsel never showed up.

If a car dealer accidentally drops off a new car at your address, but later realizes it was intended for another address, you don&#x27;t get to keep the car. Likewise, if $100,000 shows up in your bank account because it was mistakenly deposited there, that&#x27;s gonna get clawed back.But what about data? Mere information? I think there is a pretty good legal argument that there are categories of data (e.g. trade secrets) that a person can be ordered not to possess. So I think the author made the right call by agreeing to cooperate with the city&#x27;s request, even if it was the city&#x27;s own colossal error that put him in that position.Nevertheless, it would have been nice for the city to reward him for his bringing the issue to their attention, rather than immediately trying to threaten him if they didn&#x27;t help clean up their mess. reply jonah 13 hours agoparentIf a merchant mails something you didn&#x27;t order, you are allowed to keep it.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.usps.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;pub300a&#x2F;pub300a_v04_revi...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faq.usps.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;article&#x2F;What-Options-Do-I-Have-Regard...Additional discussion on if they mis-ship things to you:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;17533&#x2F;if-a-retailer-... reply cortesoft 12 hours agorootparentWhat if it is USPS who messes up, though, and delivers it to the wrong address, even though the address on the package is correct?Even more confusing, what if the package is FROM the USPS, is addressed to someone else, but accidentally delivered to you? reply judge2020 12 hours agorootparentYou are not allowed to open someone else’s mail, even if it’s in your mailbox. reply chaps 10 hours agorootparentFor mail with someone else&#x27;s name on it, sure.

Furthermore, copyright in the US does not extend to databases, such as a list of records. So there isn&#x27;t a clear legal regime under which to prosecute someone for holding onto records they recieved improperly. Physical property and even some coyrightable data would be a different story. reply bigallen 8 hours agorootparentThe City said they were going to go for a fraud and abuse case. I have 0 experience with that subject, but I would assume there would have to be an action, or intent of an action, to make it a crime. I wonder if the data simply existing on a hard drive would be enough to convict. Now that I think about it, I don&#x27;t think I have a strong moral conviction against a judge ordering someone to delete data that contains sensitive information they received in error. Jail time and a fine? Absolutely not. Forcing them to delete (and confirming deletion)? Yes. reply legitster 16 hours agoparentprev> They thanked me for bringing the situation to their attention and all that, but the mood of the call was as if both parties had a knife behind their back. Somewhere towards the end of the call, I asked them if it was okay to keep the emails. Why not at least ask, right?>...This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m even remotely cool with, so we ended the call a couple minutes later, and agreed to have our lawyers speak going forward.Honestly, the city was acting in very good faith, but OP decided to troll them and refused to cooperate with the third party auditor. To this day we have to kind of accept the affidavit he signed that data is gone. reply chaps 15 hours agorootparentThis was definitely not my first rodeo and I like to think I&#x27;ve done a good job in acting in good faith in future similar instances [1] for example. Every time I&#x27;ve reported something, the other side acts differently every single time. Sometimes they&#x27;re friendly, sometimes they put out obvious traps (\"prove it that you found HIPAA sensitive info\"), and sometimes they&#x27;re just thankful it didn&#x27;t go worse.You gotta realize that we live in a world where people have been prosecuted for using nmap. So we have to ride a fine line between careful and aggressive.I don&#x27;t expect this to be a thing that stops happening as I continue sending FOIAs. Recently a police agency released to me thousands of social security numbers from ALPR scans (of all things). When I reported it, they shrugged us off and asked us to redact the documents ourselves. When we refused (why would I accept that liability) to, they redacted more, but left in about 800 more SSNs.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;3aqagy&#x2F;contractor-exposed-th... reply legitster 14 hours agorootparentI get it. But as someone who has worked a lot of helpdesk and customer service roles in my life, all I can do is whinge. These departments clearly do not have the processes or experience to respond correctly, so the brunt of the pain is going to fall on inexperienced and overworked public servants whose whole job is to be harassed by citizens. So please be nice! reply chaps 14 hours agorootparentHeh, the city called me a good samaritan for acting in good faith, plus completely redid their entire process afterwards, including escalation paths to make this sort of thing less aggressive and conflict oriented in the future. So, uh, I&#x27;m honestly not sure what to say when things ultimately ended up better in the end.And fwiw, I&#x27;ve worked at a high volume help desk too. reply qingcharles 5 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s basically the opposite of the City of Chicago who did pretty much everything they could do behind the scenes to frustrate and ridicule you just for asking for some public information. reply gopher_space 11 hours agorootparentprevYour Seattle exchange makes perfect sense when you connect the people and the tech. You&#x27;re using web3 thinking to interface with people using web2 tools to manipulate web1 software reading data from web0 systems. Sending and receiving info through this system is sometimes literally a game of telephone, but the translation steps will be set in stone.E.g. Your email sent to IT was routed, unread, to another department. That department starts their rudimentary FOIA process which includes submitting IT-Request-4 regarding your specific date and field range. IT-Request-4 does not come with context. Seattle&#x27;s IT department now specs out adding fields to a production database and adding your custom export to the end-of-day batch. They spec out additional hosting costs because IT-Request-4 was designed as a way to create data pipelines.At this point there are only three people involved and they each have a different view on what&#x27;s happening due to a knowledge gap. You could eliminate this (imho) by providing motivation and context in your initial request.I wonder how these exchanges would look if you sent a &#x27;pre-FOIA&#x27; heads up to specific departments in a city, introducing yourself as conducting a large-scale survey of FOIA processes and letting them know your request will revolve around a year&#x27;s worth of email metadata. It feels like this could be a more collaborative process. reply dfc 9 hours agorootparentWhat is the web3 thinking? reply kelnos 16 hours agorootparentprevI would refuse to cooperate with the third party auditor as well. No one gets to scan my hard drive without a court order. And even then, I wouldn&#x27;t provide the decryption passphrase unless I was legally required to.Even though there isn&#x27;t anything illegal or incriminating on my hard drive (as far as I know, anyway), I wouldn&#x27;t agree to let someone violate my privacy for a mistake they made.Regardless, this whole thing would be \"verification theater\". OP could have copied the records out to a flash drive before deleting them from the hard drive, and hid it in his floorboards, and there&#x27;d be no record he did that. Third-party audit would say \"yep, looks like the files have been deleted off the hard drive\", and that would be that.Also, \"good faith\"? The lawyer OP ended up talking to said that their behavior seemed to indicate they were moving in the direction of CFAA charges. While we can&#x27;t know that for certain, that&#x27;s quite the opposite of good faith. reply pierat 16 hours agorootparentA simple affidavit under perjury should absolutely suffice.How do you know I didn&#x27;t upload it to S3, some torrent, IPFS, or elsewhere?I&#x27;d tell them to fuck off if they want to lay hands on my computer.. or at least come back with a court order. reply chaps 16 hours agorootparentYes, I did indeed sign an affidavit. reply thsksbd 15 hours agorootparentAnd did you have to sign it?

Why do you have to sign a legally enforceable document because some idiot messed up? reply 0cf8612b2e1e 15 hours agorootparentNot OP, but signing it probably made the mess immediately disappear. Even if there was no legal requirement, the stress and potential expenses are not worth it if the data was genuinely deleted.Taking a moral stand has costs that not everyone can bear. reply adastra22 10 hours agorootparentAnd besides it’s an affidavit not an NDA. It’s just a legal document claiming that what he said happened, did in fact happen.

No way I am letting someone scan and archive my drives&#x2F;data to correct their mistake. They broke other people’s privacy and now they want to break mine?

To be aware of your rights and state they can’t do an illegal search?Demanding a warrant to be searched is not hostile it’s the equivalent of saying no thank you. Hostile is when they have a warrant and you still refuse. reply legitster 15 hours agorootparentYou cannot get a warrant without probably cause that a crime has been committed. So asking for a warrant to search your computer is literally asking to be charged with a crime.IANAL, but demanding a prosecutor and judge be involved when dealing with an IT department is really dumb. If you can just agree with their legal team (and your lawyer) on the stipulations of the search and confirmation, you can&#x27;t be charged with further crimes if they find anything (\"fruit of the poison tree\"). But insisting on getting hit with a warrant means anything they find can be used against you. reply eli 14 hours agorootparentThis is terrible advice based on a real misunderstanding of the law. reply legitster 13 hours agorootparentHow so? What lawyer would insist on their client getting searched via a warrant? reply cortesoft 12 hours agorootparent> If you can just agree with their legal team (and your lawyer) on the stipulations of the search and confirmation, you can&#x27;t be charged with further crimes if they find anything (\"fruit of the poison tree\").This part is completely wrong. “Fruit of the poison tree” only counts if the original search was illegal. If you let them search for something specific, nothing is stopping them from using anything they find, even if it wasn’t what they were searching for (as long as they found it during the normal course of searching for the thing they were supposed to be searching for) reply legitster 11 hours agorootparentIf you get to define the terms of the search with a lawyer, wouldn&#x27;t that make the terms of any additional snooping illegal?Again, I get that a warrant is a great bar to them searching your stuff. But if they already know you have what they are looking for, a warrant seems bad! reply chaps 10 hours agorootparentFriend, I don&#x27;t know how to say this politely, but I&#x27;ll try my best: you&#x27;re really missing something fundamental here and I&#x27;m not sure what it is or why you&#x27;re so persistent on thinking it&#x27;s okay to allow a government agency full access to your drive through third party contractors. Please, for your own sake, do some independent research. Or talk to a lawyer. Or read articles about prosecutorial abuse. Many of us have told you this is a bad idea and in no uncertain terms: it&#x27;s a BAD idea to allow unfettered access to your shit.I highly recommend you take an afternoon off and sit in a criminal court room and watch how criminal cases progress through the system. Especially for things like drug crime, and especially when evidence is weak. You will learn so much.Please do that for yourself? reply eli 13 hours agorootparentprevDamn near all of them.I would challenge you to find a defense attorney who would, in general, advise you to consent to a search even if you \"have nothing to hide.\" reply legitster 11 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re not talking about a blanket consent to search. We&#x27;re talking about a controlled destruction of something dangerous. reply ethbr1 9 hours agorootparentI believe the issue people are taking with this approach is there is no \"non-blanket consent to search.\"If you invite law enforcement into your home, and they find probable cause or evidence of another crime, then they get to use that to prosecute you.You don&#x27;t get to say \"but I had an agreement they would only enter my house for the singular purpose of X.\" reply singleshot_ 12 hours agorootparentprevI don’t speak for all of us, but I would certainly be one. The “particularity” feature of a warrant would be a primary concern, as would be the involvement of someone other than LE (I.e., the magistrate or judge signing the warrant). reply legitster 11 hours agorootparentAgain, in this particular circumstance, where OP has already admitted to being in possession of the files, would there be any difficulty in obtaining a warrant for all of his computers?I&#x27;m honestly curious as to what there would be to gain on insisting on a warrant rather than just agree to some deal and avoid criminal proceedings. reply singleshot_ 9 hours agorootparentWell, then, you can just read my comment again. Particularity & a third party outside of law enforcement would be two great places to start. reply rootsudo 13 hours agorootparentprevWell, all of them really. Sure, no warrant you can make an attempt to drop evidence because of overzealous police&#x2F;executive power if there was no consent but the idea is to require documentation and to make sure the state (in this case) crosses their T&#x27;s and does their I&#x27;s before they can engage in this sort of conversation. Many times, if the case is weak, or not enforceable, a judge will not sign to execute the warrant or said people that want to search will not try to get one (either knowing it wont be granted or it would be denied.)With the warrant demand talk, I would also say that once you make the demand - you give an address where you recieve service and do not follow up or communicate anymore. reply legitster 11 hours agorootparent> Many times, if the case is weak, or not enforceable, a judge will not sign to execute the warrant or said people that want to search will not try to get one (either knowing it wont be granted or it would be denied.)Absolutely. Demanding a warrant is your protection against a weak case. But in this particular case, OP has already told authorities that they possessed contraband. The authorities already have everything they need to exercise a warrant. So insisting on one here is the exact opposite protection.Again, OP was smart and worked with a lawyer to deescalate. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 11 hours agorootparentI bet the lawyer was even more adamant that their client would not surrender their property&#x2F;submit to a search without a warrant. replysingleshot_ 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is brutally terrible legal advice, even for you not being a lawyer. reply ToucanLoucan 15 hours agorootparentprev> You cannot get a warrant without probably cause that a crime has been committed. So asking for a warrant to search your computer is literally asking to be charged with a crime.That is just completely 100% wrong. Warrants are not (or at least, shouldn&#x27;t be, your mileage may vary based on your local authorities) issued like candy. Prosecutors and judges issue warrants when there is probable cause to search in the event of a crime being committed by you, or simply being committed within an area to which you have access that the public does not. That does not mean you are being charged with a crime. I would agree that more often than not, if you are having warrants issued for searches of your home or business, a criminal prosecution for you is probably not an unreasonable thing to be concerned about, but these are not the same thing. One absolutely happens without the other all the time.> If you can just agree with their legal team on the stipulations of the search and confirmation, you can&#x27;t be charged with further crimes if they find anythingThis is the same fallacious thinking as \"If I&#x27;ve committed no crime I have nothing to fear from being searched,\" and that&#x27;s not the point: the point is it is your right to privacy that they are demanding they now have the right to encroach upon to ensure the secure and to-their-satisfaction destruction of data they erroneously sent you which cannot be performed without some element of highly invasive search, and also cannot be requested without the implication that they don&#x27;t trust you to have deleted it.This institution regardless of your individual opinions on it does not have your interest at heart: their negligence has placed the two of you as legal entities on opposing sides of a legal affair that can incredibly easily escalate to a conflict. Your lawyer is your FIRST call in this situation, and after that, you shut the fuck up and let your lawyer do their job. reply legitster 14 hours agorootparentWA state says you cannot issue a warrant without reference to a specific crime: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.leg.wa.gov&#x2F;RCW&#x2F;default.aspx?cite=10.79.035So regardless, by demanding a warrant you would be insisting that the IT Department declare a crime had been committed in the first place. Even if you wanted to defend the legality of you holding onto ill-gotten data, why would you want to get the prosecutor involved at all? Getting a warrant on your property is the worst possible outcome here.I agree you shouldn&#x27;t do anything without a lawyer closing looking over the stipulation. But demanding a warrant is probably the dumbest available option. Especially when they already know you have the thing they are looking for! reply l33t7332273 12 hours agorootparentA warrant referencing a crime is not the same as a person being charged of a crime. reply rootsudo 14 hours agorootparentprev>Especially when they already know you have the thing they are looking for!I disagree, the conversation went that they wanted to Verify it was deleted. That is totally out of grounds for the city to want. The data in this case is contraband, but it was leaked by the city, and hosted by the city in the FOIA portal.It totally misses the point, you should never consent to a search to verify you don&#x27;t have it, especially to a third party. Ever. They want to poke and prod around, then it&#x27;s a warrant and strict chain of custody. None of this third party forsenic firm stuff. replyplagiarist 13 hours agorootparentprevI can be surprised, in fact: it is my constitutional right to not be searched and they are a government entity. reply pixl97 15 hours agorootparentprevThis said, don&#x27;t be surprised if there is some government looking guy sitting at your property line with a Giger counter for a few days. reply anonexpat 16 hours agorootparentprevNot quite equivalent.

But ill-gotten property is one of them. reply jrockway 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think the OP trolled them. It&#x27;s their mistake, and he pointed out the mistake. \"We&#x27;ll hire a contractor to do whatever they want with your computer, or you go to jail.\" is not a fair way of resolving the situation. It cover&#x27;s the mistake-maker&#x27;s ass at great cost to the person who reported the mistake.Would you ever use a computer again if someone else of unknown intent had unlimited access to it for an extended period of time? I certainly wouldn&#x27;t.The suggested remedy isn&#x27;t even effective. You can&#x27;t prove that you deleted something. It could all be on an SD card buried under a rock somewhere, regardless of what the consultant finds.Frankly, given the track record of cooperation, the first offer should have been \"just delete them and sign an affidavit attesting to that\" which is exactly what happened. reply stevage 12 hours agorootparentUnknown intent?

(As, also, is the upthread claim that \"A warrant is only required for a police search\")Reasonableness is required for all government search, warrants are usually (but not categorically, there are all kinds of established exceptions to the warrant requirement) required for reasonableness. reply legitster 15 hours agorootparentprev> A warrant is required for all government searchThis is not at all true.For example, if you enter into an agreement with your state to be a foster parent, you also have to agree for the state to inspect your home regularly. It&#x27;s part of the agreement - no warrant required.The state is free to make search a condition of an agreement. So if the state wants to say \"Agree to a search or we will pursue criminal proceedings\", you are free to accept or deny their agreement. reply l33t7332273 12 hours agorootparentI think this point is needlessly pedantic because it hasn’t much to do with the topic at hand. GP’s point was that you were wrong to say that warrants are _only_ required for police searches.The search we’re talking about here is very much the kind of search that warrants a warrant. reply legitster 11 hours agorootparentAt least in the state of Washington, only police officers are authorized to execute warrants. So I don&#x27;t feel like I am being pedantic. If you are saying it requires a warrant, it&#x27;s officially a police search.I feel like I am taking crazy pills in this thread and no one has an idea of what a warrant actually is and they are just throwing it around like a magic word. reply plagiarist 13 hours agorootparentprevAgreeing to a search as part of access to a nonessential service is quite different from being extorted with the thread of criminal proceedings if you don&#x27;t allow them to violate your rights. replytetha 16 hours agorootparentprevSo they make a grave mistake from a data protection point of view.Why do I need to give a contractor access to things on my drives like my work contracts, bank statements, other contracts, encrypted SSH keys, as well as some information other people gave me to keep redundant - because of their mistake?Especially because the average one of these contractors doesn&#x27;t tend to exude competency. You know, like the first party I&#x27;m talking to which caused this whole disaster?Especially because it wouldn&#x27;t help.

Open data is data that&#x27;s released on a discretionary basis; often times a FOIA request for the same data found within open data has a legal requirement for redaction. We see this happen all the time. What&#x27;s worse is that at the executive level, eg chief data officers are often forbidden by legal teams from interacting with the media and adjacent orgs. I&#x27;ve literally been told by a CDO that they cannot speak with me.My go-to phrase for open data is, \"open data is a lie\". Because at the end of the day, we have zero legal recourse to validate that what is provided through open datasets is complete, both in terms of available columns and available rows. Very rarely will it ever be explained why, or even if, information is missing. And the subsequent effects of that lead to a deep public misunderstanding of what&#x27;s going on. And much of it is intentional out of explicit fear that the public will misinterpret the data. So we go through FOIA instead and we end up going through legal battles. There&#x27;s a reason I&#x27;ve had to do ~10 FOIA suits.tl;dr: open data is nice, but its lack of rigor and accountability makes it effectively useless for anything that requires depth. reply stevage 11 hours agorootparentPerhaps you missed the bit where I said I worked in open data for years, including inside government.They are two very different processes, yes. Open data tends to connect you with technologists and subject matter experts who want to talk about their field. FOI tends to connect you with lawyers and governance gurus who want to find reasons not to give you what you want.Around here the FOI processes are getting slower and less forthcoming, in defiance of the law, and ridiculous requests like these ones do not help make the case for their support. reply chaps 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve spoken to many people inside government who work on the open data side. To be blunt: the signal to noise ratio isn&#x27;t very good in terms of whether someone actually knows what they&#x27;re talking about. So please consider my reluctance to take much of what is said as a product of being lied to for years, both intentionally and unintentionally.Yes, FOI processes are getting slower and yes we&#x27;re going to keep suing. What other choice do we have? One thing to consider is that SO MUCH of that is a product of gov agencies simply not preparing their documents in a way that makes them FOIAable. So much can be done that simply isn&#x27;t -- a significant amount of which is very intentional (eg, police records) in an intentional violation of the law.We&#x27;re not trying to be dicks in all of this.

You might say that&#x27;s impossible, but for instance, if you knew that you happened to send specific e-mails to people in that dataset, you could correlate the times to discover your own hash, then filter by your hash and use the times to correlate with who you sent them to. Now you know the hashes of everyone you corresponded with, and can do PII-based analysis on that, e.g. how many people e-mailed them and when, whether they responded, who else they e-mailed after receiving those e-mails (so you might be able to start identifying colleagues etc), etc.PII, even in what looks to be anonymous data, is very valuable to people who are determined to mine it, which is why typically data such as this should only be disclosed in aggregate, and usually after verifying that each aggregated set of data actually covers a large enough group of individuals that also can&#x27;t be correlated another way. reply jabroni_salad 12 hours agoparentprevPublic records are for the public!

A controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM)-scanning proposal that’s under discussion by lawmakers in Europe is both the wrong response to tackling a sensitive and multifaceted societal problem and a direct threat to democratic values in a free and open society, a seminar organized by the European Data Protection Supervisor heard yesterday. More than 20 speakers at the three hour event voiced opposition to a European Union legislative proposal that would require messaging services to scan the contents of users’ communications for known and unknown CSAM, and to try to detect grooming taking place in real-time — putting the comms of all users of apps subject to detection orders under an automatic and non-targeted surveillance dragnet. Critics argue the approach runs counter to the fundamental freedoms that are pivotal to democratic societies. The European Commission has pushed back aggressively against this sort of criticism to date — arguing the proposal is a proportionate and targeted response to a growing problem. It was even spotted recently using microtargeted ads to promote the plan, apparently turning to covert targeting to attack critics by suggesting they do not support child protection (despite the existence of another live EU legislative proposal that seeks to restrict the use of political microtargeting… so, er, oops!). The contentious debate is still live as it’s now up to EU co-legislators, in the European Parliament and Member States, via the Council, to hash out (no pun intended!) a way forward — which means there’s still time for regional lawmakers to pull back. And the need for the bloc to pull back from this brink was absolutely the message from yesterday’s event. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) himself, Wojciech Wiewiórowski, suggested the EU could be at a point of no return if lawmakers go ahead and pass a law that mandates the systemic, mass surveillance of private messaging. In his opening remarks, he suggested the Commission’s proposal could bring consequences that go “well beyond what concerns with the protection of children”. “It is often being used in the debate that this proposal is only about protecting children. I would like this to be the case — but it’s not,” he went on, arguing that the Commission’s proposal questions the “foundations” of what privacy means in a democratic society; and pointing out that privacy, once undermined, leads to “the radical shift from which there might be no return”, as he put it. Without amendments, the proposal would “fundamentally change the Internet and the digital communication as we know it”, Wiewiórowski also warned at the event’s close — invoking his personal childhood experience of living under surveillance and restrictions on freedom of expression imposed by the Communist regime in Poland. And, most certainly, it’s an awkward comparison for the EU’s executive to be asked to contemplate coming from the mouth of one of its own expert advisors. The EDPS, an EU institution which advises the Commission on data protection and privacy, is not a newly converted critic of the Commission proposal either. Indeed, the Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board put out a joint opinion a full year ago that warned the legislative plan raises “serious data protection and privacy concerns” — including for encryption. But that joint expression of concern from inside the EU has — so far — failed to persuade Johansson or the Commission to rethink their full-throated backing for mass surveillance of citizens’ private communications. Seminar attendees heard that Johansson had been invited to attend but the event but had declined to do so. Nor did anyone else from the Commission agree to attend. (We’ve reached out to the Commission and Johansson’s office about her decision not to participate and will update our report if we get a response). Mounting concerns The Commission presented its draft CSAM legislation back in May 2022. Since then opposition has been building over human rights impacts as the implications of the proposal have become clearer. While concerns — and even suspicions — about the driving forces behind the proposal have mounted, not helped by a perceived lack of engagement from the Commission with civil society organizations and others expressing genuinely held misgivings. The emotive debate has also, at times, lent itself to unhelpful polarization. Even from the start there were clear questions about the legality of the proposal. EU law requires any interferences with fundamental rights like privacy and freedom of expression to be necessary and proportionate. While the imposition of a general content monitoring obligation on online platforms is prohibited — so how does that square with a law that could put the messages of hundreds of millions of Europeans under watch by design? Giving a perspective on the legality at yesterday’s seminar, Frederik Borgesius, professor at iHub, Radboud University, in the Netherlands, said in his view the Commission’s proposal is not a proportionate way of interfering with fundamental rights. He referred back to case law on data retention for terrorism — as the most relevant comparison — which has seen the bloc’s top court repeatedly strike down general and indiscriminate storage of Europeans’ metadata. (Not that that’s stopped Member States from keeping on breaking the law, though… ) “Actually, the court might not even get to a proportionality test because the data retention cases were about metadata. And this is about analysing the content of communications,” he went on. “The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights has an element that says if the essence of a fundamental right is violated then the measure is illegal by definition — there’s not even a need for a proportionality test.” Borgesius also pointed out there’s case law on this essence point too. “When is the essence violated? Well, the court has said — in a different case — if authorities can access the contents of communications on such a large scale then the discussion is over,” he explained. “No room for proportionality test — the essence of the right to privacy would be violated, and therefore such a measure would be illegal.” Legality is just one element the seminar considered. Multiple critics of the Commission’s proposal speaking at the event also argued it’s even ill-fitted in its main claimed purpose — of addressing the complex societal problem of child sexual abuse — and actually risks causing unintended consequences, including for children. The seminar heard repeated concerns from panellists that minors could end up being harmed because of the regulation’s single-minded focus on scanning private comms, with speakers emphasizing the importance of evidence-based policymaking in such a sensitive area, rather than a blinding rushing down the road of technosolutionism. One issue several speakers raised is that a large proportion of the sexualized content involving minors that’s being shared online is actually being done so by (and between) consenting minors (i.e. sexting). The Commission proposal could therefore lead to children being investigated and even criminalizing for exploring their own sexual identities, they suggested — since understanding what is and isn’t CSAM is not something that can necessarily be done by simply reviewing the imagery itself. The Commission’s proposal hinges on the idea of forcing messaging platforms which are suspected of hosting CSAM to scan for illegal content (and grooming activity) and pass flagged content to a European Center to carry out initial checks — but also potentially send reported content on to law enforcement agencies. Certainly in the case of new CSAM (i.e. suspected CSAM content that has not been previously seen, investigated and confirmed as illegal child sexual abuse material), context is essential to any assessment of what is being depicted. This is not something an AI scanning tool, or even a trained human looped in to review flagged imagery, can inherently know just by looking at a piece of content, the seminar heard. So a law that automates CSAM scanning and reporting without there being a foolproof way to distinguish between actual CSAM, innocent sexting between kids, or even just a parent sending a family holiday snap to a relative via a private messaging channel they believe to be a safe way to share personal stories, looks the opposite of an intelligent response to child sexual abuse. “A big part of the material that we see is not a result of sexual abuse,” Arda Gerkens, chair of the board of The Netherlands’ Authority for the Prevention of Online Terrorist Content and Child Sexual Abuse Material, told the seminar. “The material’s indeed being spread by the Internet — but it’s a growing number which is a result of sexual activity of young people themselves.” The risk of “leaked images and sextortion” are “even more reason why we should keep the Internet safe and secure”, she also suggested — pointing out children can be put in an exceptionally vulnerable position if their accounts are hacked and their private comms fall into the hands of someone who wants to manipulate and abuse them. “The scanning of private communication will certainly flag problematic situations — I definitely know that that’s already happening — but it’s not the solution to combat this sexual child abuse,” she went on, speaking up in favor of a narrower practice of scanning for known CSAM on image hosting websites to stop the further spread of material — “but not to prosecute”. The legislation proposed by the Commission doesn’t properly address image hosting websites as potential repositories of CSAM, she suggested, because it’s too focused on “private communication and subsequently prosecution”. She therefore predicted the EU’s approach will be “counterproductive” when it comes to detecting perpetrators and ending domestic sexual violence. “The sheer amount of images will overflow the systems we have and put even more pressure on the fragile law enforcement systems,” she suggested, adding: “It would be much better to invest in those systems and strengthen collaborations between the EU countries.” Another speaker, Susan Landau, bridge professor in cyber security and Policy at Tufts University, also argued the Commission’s proposal misunderstands a multifaceted and highly sensitive issue — failing to respond to different (and distinct) types of child sexual abuse and exploitation that can occur over the Internet. An approach that’s centered on investigation and prosecution, as the Commission’s is, would hit a wall in many cases, she also predicted — pointing out, for example, that an overwhelming majority of Internet-enabled sex trafficking cases involve victims being abused by people close to them, who they do not want to report. “What you need there, as well as with real time abuse, is spaces that make children safe. Community spaces. Online safety education. Education about online security and safety by design,” she suggested. “The point is that the law requires scanning to handle the child sexual abuse and exploitation issue misunderstands the issue,” Landau added. “There are multiple ways… to prevent and investigate the crime [of child sexual abuse] that are not affected by end-to-end encryption (E2EE) . Meanwhile, end-to-end encryption is a technology that secures both children and adults.” Also speaking during the event was Alexander Hanff, a privacy expert and advocate — who is himself a survivor of child sexual abuse. He too asserted that a lot of sexualized imagery of children that’s shared online is being done privately between consenting minors. But the impact the Commission’s proposal would have on minors who sext is not something the EU’s executive appears to have considered. “If we now introduce a law which requires the scanning of all digital communications, and by that we’re talking billions, tens of billions of communications every single day across the EU, those images would then be sent to multiple individuals along the chain of investigation — including Europol and various law enforcement bodies, etc — creating victims,” he warned. “Because one of the things that we see in relation to CSAM, and speaking as a survivor myself, is the impact on the dignity of the individuals for whom it relates. “The very fact that people are viewing these images — which is exactly the intent of the Commission to try and overcome — is a form of abuse itself. So if we now take innocent pictures, which have been shared among consenting individuals, and expose them to potentially hundreds of other individuals down the investigation chain then we are indeed actually creating more victims as a result of this.” Another attendee — WhatsApp’s public policy director, Helen Charles — chipped into the discussion to offer an industry view, saying that while the Meta-owned messaging platform supports EU lawmakers in their aim of tackling child sexual abuse, it shares concerns that the Commission’s approach is not well targeted at this multifaceted problem; and that it risks major unintended consequences for web users of all ages. “We think that any outcome that requires scanning of content in end-to-end encrypted messaging would undermine fundamental rights, as several colleagues have set out,” she told the seminar. “Instead, the draft regulation should set the right conditions for services like WhatsApp and other end-to-end encrypted services to mitigate the misuse of our services in a way that’s reasonable and proportionate but that also considers both the different nature of harm… but also includes things like prevention and other upstream measures that could help tackle these kinds of harms.” Charles went on to advocate for EU lawmakers to give platforms more leeway to use “traffic data” (i.e. metadata; not comms content) for the prevention of child sexual abuse under the EU’s existing ePrivacy Directive — noting that the current (temporary) ePrivacy derogation for platforms, which lets them scan non-E2EE messages for CSAM, only covers detection, reporting and takedown, not prevention. “Having access to some data can be helpful in a targeted proportionate way to address those risks,” she argued. “Where it is legal Meta does deploy techniques, including the use of traffic data, to identify potentially problematic behaviour. This is not just about detection, though. This is also about prevention… [T]raffic data can be an important signal when used with other signals to help services proactively disrupt violating message groups and accounts who may be seeking to abuse our services. “So we would encourage institutions, when they’re thinking about the way forward here, to both ensure end-to-end encryption is protected and that services can tackle CSAM without accessing message content but also look at ways that EPG traffic data can be processed in a proportionate and targeted manner, including for prevention. We think, in this way, the regulation will move closer to achieving its objectives.” The seminar also heard concerns about the limitations of the current state of the art in AI-based CSAM detection. A big issue here is AI tools used to detect known CSAM are proprietary — with no independent verification of claims made for their accuracy, said Jaap-Henk Hoepman, visiting professor in computer science at Karlstad University. “The problem is that the [CSAM detection] techniques being discussed — either PhotoDNA [developed by Microsoft] or NeuralHash [made by Apple] — are proprietary and therefore not publicly available and known and study-able algorithms — which means that we simply have to rely on the figures provided by the companies on how effective these technologies are.” He also pointed to work by academics and other researchers who have reverse engineered PhotoDNA that he said revealed some elementary flaws — such as evidence it’s particularly easy to evade detection against a known CSAM fingerprint by simply rotating or mirroring the image. “Clearly this has implications for the proportionality of the [Commission] proposal, because a serious breach of privacy is being proposed for an not-so-effective measure,” he added, going on to warn about risks from “targeted false positives” — where attackers seek to manipulate an image so that an algorithm detects it as CSAM when, to the human eye, it looks innocuous — either to frame an innocent person or trick app users into forwarding a doctored image (and, if enough people share it, he warned it could flood detection systems and even cause a DDoS-like event). “This technology is not free from error — and we’re talking many billions of communications [being scanned] every day. So even if we have a 0.1% error rate that accounts for many millions of false positives or false negatives on a daily basis. Which is not something that we can subscribe to in a democracy,” Hanff also warned, chiming in with a technosocial perspective on flawed AI tools. Claudia Peersman, a senior research associate in the Cyber Security Research Group of the University of Bristol, had a pertinent assessment to offer related to work she’d been involved with at the Rephrain Centre. The expert academic group recently independently assessed five proof-of-concept projects, developed in the U.K. with government backing, to scan E2EE content for CSAM without — per the Home Office’s headline claim — compromising people’s privacy. The problem is, none of the projects lived up to that billing. “None of these tools were able to meet [our assessment] criteria. I think this is the most important part of our conclusion. Which does not mean that we do not support the development of AI supported tools for online child protection in general. We just believe that the tools are not ready to be deployed on such a large scale on private messages within end-to-end encrypted environments,” she told the seminar. Delegates also heard a warning that client-side scanning — the technology experts suggest the EU law will force onto E2EE platforms such as WhatsApp if/when they’re served with a CSAM detection order — is far too new and immature to be rushed into mainstream application. “As computer science researchers we’ve just begun to look at this technology,” said Matthew Green, a cryptographer professor at The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. “I want to stress how completely new the idea of client side scanning is — the very first computer science research papers on the topic appeared in 2021 and we’re not even two years later, and we’re already discussing laws that mandate it.” “The problem of building systems where [content scanning] algorithms are confidential and can’t be exploited is something we’re just beginning to research. And so far, many of our technical results are negative — negative in the sense that we keep finding ways to break these systems,” he also told the seminar. “Break them means that we will ultimately violate the confidentiality of many users. We will cause false positives. We will cause bad data to be injected into the system. “And, in some cases, there’s this possibility that abuse victims may be re traumatised if the systems are built poorly… I’m just a computer scientist. I’m not a legislator or a lawyer. My request to this community is please, please give us time. To actually do the research, to figure out whether and how to do this safely before we start to deploy these systems and mandate them by law.” Children’s rights being ignored? A number of speakers also had passionate critiques that the views (and rights) of children themselves are being ignored by lawmakers — with several accusing the Commission of failing to consult kids about a proposal with severe implications for children’s rights, as well as for the privacy and fundamental rights of everyone who uses digital comms tools. “We should involve the children,” said Gerkens. “We are speaking here about them. We are judging about what they do online. We have a moral opinion about it. But we’re not talking to them. They are the ones we are speaking about. We haven’t involved them in this legislation. I think we should.” Sabine Witting, assistant professor at Leiden University, also warned over a raft of “negative” impacts on kids’ rights — saying the EU proposal will affect children’s right to privacy, personal data protection, freedom of expression and access to information. “In this context, I really would like to highlight that — from a children’s rights perspective — privacy and protection are not contradicting each other. Actually, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and its General Comment number 25, made it very clear that privacy is actually vital for children’s safety. So privacy is not a hindrance of children’s safety as it’s often projected. It’s actually an important precondition to safety,” she said. Witting also had a strong message about the harms that could accrue for adolescents whose private texts to each other get sucked up and caught in a CSAM-scanning dragnet. “The investigation alone can already be very, very harmful for affected adolescents, especially in cases where we have adolescents from marginalised communities. For example, LGBTQ+ children,” she warned. “Because this kind of investigation might lead to false disclosure, further marginalisation and in a worst case scenario, also political persecution or the like, so children and adolescents being targets of a criminal investigation is already harmful in and of themselves. “Unfortunately the proposal will not be able to prevent that from happening. So this whole process of scanning private communications among adolescents of the most intimate nature, the further review by private sector, by government, the potential involvement of law enforcement, all of that is really a significant violation of children’s right to privacy.” Witting said she’d raised this issue with the Commission — but had no response. “I think because there is just no simple answer,” she added. “Because it lies in the nature of the subject matter that these kinds of cases will not be able to be filtered out along the process.” The idea of the EU passing a law that sanctions warrantless searches of everyone’s “digital worlds” was skewered more generally by Iverna McGowan, director of the European office of the Center for Democracy and Technology. “What essentially the detection orders amount to are warrantless searches of our digital worlds,” she argued. “We would of course never expect or accept that law enforcement would enter our homes, or private setting, with no warrants and no reasonable suspicion to search everything belonging to us. And so we cannot of course, allow that to happen on the online space either because it would be a death knell to the rule of law and criminal law as we know it in the digital context.” Going on to offer some thoughts on how to salvage something from the Commission proposal — i.e. to undo the existential threat is poses to European values and democracy — would, she suggested, require a fundamental rewriting of the detection order provisions. Including to ensure provisions are formulated with “sufficient precision” to not apply to people whose conduct is not suspected of being criminal. She also argued for an independent judicial authority being invoked to sign off searches and verify the purposes and basis upon which individuals or groups of people are suspected. Plus proportionality tests built in — to determine whether the law allows for a truly independent assessment. “If you consider that all of these different elements would have to be in line in order for detection order to be lawful then I think we’re in a very challenging situation at the moment with the text that’s on the table before us,” she cautioned. Mission creep was another concern raised by several speakers — with panellists pointing to documents obtained by journalists that suggest Europol wants unfiltered access to data obtained under the CSAM-scanning proposal. “[We] know that the objective of Europol is to become a data hub and to also enlarge and strengthen its missions,” said MEP Saskia Bricmont. “Is there a risk of function creep? I think there is obviously, not only because of what has happened before in the evolution of the legislation around Europol but also because it seems that Europol has been pushing to obtain, in this legislation, what it aims for — namely, collect data, extend access to data and filter data — and which is also reflected in the Commission’s proposal.” She noted this requires all reports “not manifestly unfounded” to be sent simultaneously to Europol and national law enforcement agencies. “So far the European Parliament’s position is not going in that direction… But, nevertheless, the initial proposal of the Commission is going in that direction and… Europol has been also pushing for extended detection to other crime areas beyond CSAM.” No dialogue The event was being held two days before Ylva Johansson, the bloc’s commissioner for Home Affairs — who has been the driving force behind the CSAM-scanning proposal — is due to attend a hearing with the European Parliament’s civil rights committee. Critics have accused Johansson personally, and the Commission generally, of a lack of transparency and accountability around the controversial proposal. So the meeting will be closely watched and, most likely, rather a tense affair (to put it mildly). One key criticism — also aired during the seminar — is that EU lawmakers are using the highly sensitive and emotive issue of child abuse to push a blanket surveillance plan on the region that would drastically impact the fundamental rights of hundreds of millions of Europeans. “What I find really problematic is the instrumentalization of such a sensitive topic, emotional question also related to the fight — and legitimate fight and prior fights — against child sexual abuse,” said Bricmont. “And this is also what we as MEPs as European parliament have to dig into, and we will have the exchanges with the commissioner in our LIBE Committee. Because we want to know more about this and other revelations of BalkanInsight’s [investigative reporting] when it comes to potential conflicts of interests.” “Let us regret the absence of the Commission because I think we need dialogue,” she added. “I think we need to share knowledge and information in this file and that the fact that there’s a closed door [increases] suspicion also. If we want to believe that the intentions are positive and to fight against child sexual abuse then it means that every party, every person needs to be also open to the counter arguments and bring founded arguments to explain why they want to go into that direction. “So the question is, is the Commission misled? Misinformed? What is it? And this is also true for the Council side — because we know [there is there] probably also a lack of understanding of what is discussed today, and the risks related to the end of end-to-end encryption.” Earlier this month Johansson responded to critics by penning a blog post that denounced what she suggested had included personal attacks on her and attacked those who have been raising doubts, including over opaque lobbying around the file — after journalists questioned the level of access given to lobbyists for commercial entities involved in selling so-called safety tech who stand to benefit from a law that makes use of such tools mandatary. She went so far as to suggest that civil society opposition to the CSAM-scanning proposal may be acting as a sock puppet for Big Tech interests. “The biggest digital rights NGO in Europe gets funding from the biggest tech company in the world. EDRI, the European Digital Rights NGO, publishes on its website that it receives funding from Apple,” she wrote. “Apple was accused of moving encryption keys to China, which critics say could endanger customer data. Yet no-one asks if these are strange bedfellows, no-one assumes Apple is drafting EDRI’s speaking points.” Ella Jakubowska, senior policy advisor at EDRi, did not engage directly with the commissioner’s attack on her employer during her own contribution to the seminar. Instead she dedicated her two-to-three minutes of speaking time to calling out the Commission for asking Europeans to make a false choice between privacy and safety. “This disingenuous narrative has been reiterated in surveys which have crassly asked people if they agree that the ability to detect child abuse is more important than the right to online privacy,” she said. “This is a misrepresentation of both privacy and safety — as if we can all altruistically give up some of our privacy in order to keep children safe online. It doesn’t work in that way. And this sort of attitude really failed to grasp the deep social roots of the crime that we are talking about. To the contrary, I think it’s clear that privacy and safety are mutually reinforcing.” Jakubowska also accused the EU’s executive of seeking to manipulate public support for its proposal by deploying leading survey questions. (Johansson’s blog post pointed to a new Eurobarometer poll which she claimed showed massive public support for laws that regulate online service providers to fight child sexual abuse, including 81% supporting platforms having obligations to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse.) She went on to highlight concerns that the proposal poses risks to professional secrecy (such as lawyer client privilege), warning: “This of course, on the surface should be of concern to all of us in a democratic society. But even more so when we’re thinking about this crime of child sexual abuse, where securing convictions of perpetrators is so deeply important. The idea that this law could stand in the way of already fragile access to justice for survivors should not be taken lightly. But this element was not even considered in the Commission’s proposal.” She also highlighted the risk of negative impacts on children’s political participation — which she said is an angle that’s been under-examined by lawmakers, despite children’s rights law requiring their voices to be listened to in legislation that will impact young people. “We’ve heard very little from children and young people themselves. In fact, in a representative survey that was undertaken earlier this year, it was found that 80% of young people aged between 13 and 17 from across 13 EU Member States would not feel comfortably being politically active or exploring their sexuality if authorities were able to monitor their digital communication. And that was specifically asked if it was being done for the purpose of scanning for child sexual abuse. So it’s really clear when we asked young people if this is the sort of measure that they want to keep them safe that this is not the answer,” she suggested. The final panellist to speak during the event was MEP Patrick Breyer who has been a stalwart voice raised in opposition of the CSAM-scanning proposal — aka, “Chatcontrol” as he’s pithily dubbed it — ever since the controversial plan popped up on the EU’s horizon. During the seminar he described the proposal as “unprecedented in the free world”, suggesting it has led to unhelpfully polarized arguments both for and against. The more fruitful approach for policymakers would, he argued, be to work for consensus — to “try to bring the two sides together”, by keeping bits of the proposal everyone can get behind and then — “consensually” — adding “new, effective approaches” to push for something that “can protect children much better”. Discussing how the proposal might be amended to reduce negative impacts and bolster protections for kids, Breyer said a new approach is needed — one that doesn’t just remove the controversial detection orders but focused on prevention by “strictly limiting the scanning of communications to persons presumably involved in child sexual exploitation”. So targeted investigations, not Chatcontrol. “That’s the only way to avoid involvement in court and achieving nothing at all for our children,” he argued. Per Breyer, MEPs who support reforming the proposal are working hard to achieve such changes in the Parliament. But — so far — he said the Council is “refusing any measure of targeting”. “We also need to avoid un-targeted voluntary detection by industry, both concerning content and metadata, because it suffers the same problems for proportionality as the mandated detected,” he went on. “And the same goes for not turning our personal devices into scanners, in order to back door encryption. So we need to explicitly exclude client-side scanning… What the Council is looking at — some vague commitments to how important encryption is — does not do the job.” On detection, as an alternative to unacceptable mass surveillance he spoke up in favor of proactive crawling of publicly accessible material — which he noted is already being done the U.K. and Canada — as a way to “clean the web”. The proposed new EU Centre could be tasked with doing that, he suggested, along with focusing on crime prevention, victim support and best practices for law enforcement. In wider remarks, he also urged lawmakers to resist calls to impose mandatory age verification on platforms as another ill-thought through child safety measure — suggesting the focus should instead be placed on making services safe by design. “Shouldn’t profiles be restricted to being private unless the user explicitly wants to make them publicly visible? Should anybody be able to reach out to new users and to send them all sorts of photos without the user even being asked? And shouldn’t the users have the right to decide whether they want to see nude photos? It’s possible to tell on the device without giving any information to the provider. Such confirmation could also go a long way to warning teenagers and children of what could be the consequences — and maybe offering them to reach out for support.” But non-technical solutions are ultimately “key” to preventing child sexual abuse, he suggested, emphasizing: “We can’t focus just on technical approaches only. The stakes if EU lawmakers fail to reach a sensible revision of the proposal in trilogue negotiations on this file are grave indeed, he also warned — with the possibility that a CSAM-scanning law could mean “the end of truly confidential private messaging and secure encryption” — and also “pave the way to introducing unprecedented authoritarian methods to democracies”. It is the thin end of the wedge, in Breyer’s view. “If they start scanning our communications without cause what prevents them from scanning our devices, or even from scanning our homes? There is technology of shot detection; everything can be done with AI. And I think if that precedent is set — that it is justified to intrude in personal and private spaces just because they could be some hint of a crime — then this very much destroys the essence of the right to privacy,” he suggested. “But if we prevail with our views, I think we can set a global example for protecting children online in line with our values. And that’s what I’m fighting for. Not just for our generation but also for our children, because I want them to grow up in a free world where we trust each other and not in a surveillance state of mutual fear.” More TechCrunch When was the last time Marc Andreessen talked to a poor person?

The most recent of these told me the photo was sent as a (pretty awful) prank in a WhatsApp group, and their phone auto-saved it to the camera roll. All of these folks lost all access to Google services with minimal options for appeal, and have had their lives disrupted in various ways I can’t imagine.I have no way of verifying what these people are telling me, and I can’t help them even if I did. And even more than this: my first reaction is to wonder if they’re all actually pedophiles who are just lying to me, and&#x2F;or if they’re going to text CSAM at me. (Because that’s the power of this accusation — nobody will trust you once they hear it.)Some of these folks have had their lives ruined and some have told me they were hospitalized and considered suicide, even though they weren’t actually prosecuted. I can certainly imagine being in their situation due to the mistake of having an asshole friend-of-a-friend in a group chat and some bad settings in my phone. (I have neither, thankfully.)If none of this stuff convinces you, here is a much more carefully-documented version of a similar story in which a dad took a photo of their toddler’s rash and was subsequently investigated for CSAM. This one has the “happy” ending that the accused is entirely cleared by the police, but never gets his Google account back and has to live with whatever other trauma and shame comes from the investigation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;21&#x2F;technology&#x2F;google-surveil... reply omginternets 8 hours agorootparentIt’s even worse than this because once the idea of mass CSAM-scanning is normalized, a false accusation is immediately credible (they would know, after all…) reply wepple 12 hours agorootparentprevThat’s an utter nightmare of a situation I’d never considered, or prepared to defend against.I hope the “prankster” ends up caught and in prison reply ChrisKnott 12 hours agorootparentprevI understand how the system can lead to people losing access to their Google account, GP suggested people could lose access to their children.

Not necessarily permanently, however the experience of family separation even for a few days can be traumatic. Criminal investigations can often take more than a few days of course.At the same time, there are unfortunately many counterexamples of abusive parents not being separated from their children via the same mechanisms. Sometimes this is from the abusers being \"good criminals\" and not getting caught; but sometimes it&#x27;s from LEOs being bad LEOs and not doing the catching.My point was that in a system which surveils ~500M people, even an FP rate of ~0.01% is 50k people. Supposing the LEOs tasked with filtering this into credible (and triable) cases further manage to, through amazing police work, confirm the innocence of 99% of those false positives.

It means that younger than that, a child simply cannot legally consent, any sex act is rape, no matter how well informed and how much the child wants it.But it doesn&#x27;t mean anything after that is a free pass, you still need actual consent. And manipulating someone into having sex is not consent, no matter the age, but it is especially true for minors who are easy targets. There may also be laws where for having sex with a minor also require consent from a legal guardian.

But in fact, they&#x27;re conflating the two things often enough - a 19 year old having sex with a 14 year old is most definitely not a pedophile, but he could be breaking the law still which makes him a criminal.But hey - let&#x27;s throw in one more twist here. 100 years ago or so, said 19 year old would have been committing pedophilia, because the age of puberty has dropped drastically since then.All that said - I&#x27;m not going to die on the hill of suggesting an Ephebophile is less bad than a Pedophile.

The biological definition of \"child\" is that of an individual between birth and puberty- i.e. an individual who hasn&#x27;t reached biological sexual maturity.A pedophile is someone who is attracted to prepubescent individuals, below the age of 13. Someone attracted to sexually mature teenagers is not, technically, a pedophile, whatever moral panic Americans might display about it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I agree it&#x27;s, well, seriously questionable.

But I will get annoyed if my country is going to continue to turn a blind eye to the physical sexual abuse of children while making out that this is an urgent problem.It&#x27;s just insulting and hurtful to suggest that at the same age if instead of being \"raped\"[1] she was just coerced into sending nudes online that the state would have cared.[1] I understand legally the UK doesn&#x27;t consider an adult man exploiting and having sex with a 16 year old rape, but regardless this how my girlfriend feels about what happened to her so I will use that word anyway. reply fluoridation 12 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m bothered that they&#x27;re pretending they care about children when they don&#x27;t.

Otherwise we don&#x27;t care about the victims of sexual abuse.>She was taken to a hotel by a married man who she thought loved her for sex, then she later found out he was just using her and other \"English slags\" for sex.Sorry your girlfriend feels otherwise, but that&#x27;s not sexual abuse, and it has nothing to do with whether she was young or not. There&#x27;s no age when a woman cannot agree to have sex with a man who says he loves her but actually he just wants sex; in fact, it&#x27;s quite a common occurrence. It&#x27;s not about sex, it&#x27;s about experience; when you&#x27;re inexperienced or trusting it&#x27;s easier for others to take advantage of you.

These can be licensed and supervised.I think this provides a decent tradeoff to a bunch of problems:- people can still enjoy fairly strong encryption- states can&#x27;t spy on people willy-nilly- but will be able to do it, with a lot of effort, where they are really motivated- sure, \"bad guys\" can still download GPG and encrypt something with a very hard cipher - but that in itself will be an offense... reply omginternets 13 hours agoparentYou may want to read up about the so-called \"crypto wars\" of the 90&#x27;s. You&#x27;ll find it illuminating. reply kmeisthax 13 hours agoparentprevEncryption is either strong or it isn&#x27;t - there&#x27;s no room for a \"breakable by governments but not by anyone else\" tier of encryption. We learned this lesson the hard way with \"export grade crypto\" - i.e. the reason why DVDs were so hilariously easy to decrypt. The safety margin of how many bits there are between \"breakable with a smartphone\" and \"unbreakable by every computer on earth\" is very thin, and it shifts a lot, so the NSA has no advantage over &#x27;bad guys&#x27;. The moment the NSA can brute-force a key so can anyone with a botnet of compromised AWS instances.Alternative proposals to force messaging apps to provide decryption keys for otherwise securely encrypted material aren&#x27;t any better, because computers and encryption algorithms cannot read and understand a court order[0]. So if the keys are held by the government then they can decrypt everything without actually needing to ask someone else and prove that all the constitutionally-mandated procedures were followed. If the keys are held by the communications service, then they can at least theoretically refuse an illegal order[1], but then they run the risk of insiders stealing people&#x27;s secrets.Remember that the push for E2E encryption started specifically because of two related trends:- Intelligence agencies doing incredibly sketchy shit to bypass encryption at major tech companies (e.g. that NSA diagram explaining how you can get implants into Google datacenters and bypass the encryption)- Companies wanting to protect the privacy of their users from themselves, because they hire a lot of people with potentially too much access to the production equipment.Banning E2E, going back to \"export grade encryption\", or demanding decryption capability rolls both of these back significantly. You can engineer a key escrow &#x2F; backdoor system to resist one particular kind of attack at the expense of making another easier, but you can&#x27;t eliminate both while maintaining nonconsentual decryption capability.[0] This is a corrolary of that old IBM saying: \"a computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision\".[1] Let&#x27;s put aside the whole \"no expectation of privacy on metadata\" nonsense for now. While that is already a privacy nightmare, opening up communications content to unlimited decryption is a bigger can of worms. reply simonw 15 hours agoparentprevThis is a terrible idea.

Heart attacks were frequent, especially in patients with underlying risk factors, and there were numerous cases of myocarditis, which occurs when the heart’s muscle layers become inflamed. Roughly a quarter of patients with severe COVID-19 had elevated blood levels of troponin, a protein marker for cardiac damage. This evidence altered how COVID-19 was viewed; previously considered primarily a form of pneumonia, it now took on a coronary dimension. “We began to understand that it’s also a cardiovascular disease,” says Peter Libby, the Mallinckrodt Professor of Medicine at HMS and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have since fallen off, the result of widespread vaccinations and the population’s growing immunity against severe disease. But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is still with us, along with the risk it poses to heart health, especially in people with blocked arteries, hypertension, diabetes, and other predisposing factors. Millions of people who recover from COVID-19 have gone on to develop lingering cardiovascular symptoms, including abnormal heartbeats, dizziness, and shortness of breath. The number of COVID-19 cases is once again spiking — and the coronavirus continues to evolve. The latest omicron variant, BA.2.86, has more than thirty mutations that could allow it to evade the immune system’s defenses. Given the ongoing threat, research into COVID-19’s cardiovascular effects “remains vitally important,” says Anne-Marie Anagnostopoulos, a cardiologist and an HMS instructor in medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “We need a greater understanding of the associated pathophysiology to develop better treatments.” Heart ills resulting from COVID In most people — especially those who’ve been vaccinated — COVID-19 produces flu-like symptoms that typically resolve within a few days or weeks. But other people progress to a second, and more dangerous, phase of the disease, as pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines proliferate in the blood. During this so-called cytokine storm, the immune system becomes hyperactive, “causing a different set of problems,” says Dara Lee Lewis, MD ’92, an HMS instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women’s and director of noninvasive testing and co-director of the Women’s Cardiology Program at the Lown Cardiology Group in Boston. “Patients can develop weakened heart muscles, low oxygen levels, blood clots, fluid in the lungs — problems that may require hospitalization.” We need a greater understanding of the associated pathophysiology to develop better treatments. More importantly, pre-existing cardiac risk factors, such as coronary artery disease and obesity — which can predispose patients to metabolic inflammation — raise the likelihood for poor outcomes. People with vulnerable hearts, Lee Lewis explains, are more likely to succumb to COVID-19 complications than others who do not have these risk factors. In a worst-case scenario, patients could experience a type 1 myocardial infarction, which is a heart attack caused when a blood clot blocks flow in the arteries. But COVID-19 patients are also unusually prone to a different type of heart attack called a type 2 myocardial infarction. In these cases, the problem isn’t a blockage in the arteries, but rather a mismatch between oxygen supply and oxygen demand. Fever and inflammation accelerate heart rate and increase metabolic demands on many organs, including the heart. If infected lungs are incapable of effectively exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide, then stressed hearts might suffer damage due to insufficient oxygen. Lee Lewis says that early in the pandemic, myocarditis was also a major concern, especially for student athletes. “These kids didn’t need to just go back to work and life,” she says. “They needed to get back to competitive play.” Some students she cared for who had been sick with COVID-19 showed up with chest pain, racing hearts, shortness of breath, and evidence of myocarditis on magnetic resonance imaging. Dara Lee Lewis Studies from around the world were reporting that up to one-third of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 also showed evidence of asymptomatic myocarditis on imaging studies. This was troubling, since post-viral myocarditis is a known cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. “We worried that many of our student athletes would be unable to return to competitive play,” Lee Lewis says. Fortunately, the asymptomatic cases turned out to be uneventful, and the affected students made full recoveries. “Asymptomatic myocarditis wasn’t as big an issue as we initially feared it would be,” Lee Lewis adds. “So, we stopped doing MRIs on everyone who walked in the door.” A push to understand SARS-CoV-2 That COVID-19 could be so closely associated with heart health wasn’t entirely unexpected. Scientists already knew that other types of infections, such as flu and bacterial sepsis, can amplify cardiac risk factors. It’s not uncommon for older people to have inactive plaques in coronary arteries. The plaques can be destabilized by a localized inflammatory response to remote infections. COVID-19 put a spotlight on these connections and led to greater awareness of the interplay between infections and cardiac disease. But as an unknown virus, SARS-CoV-2 raised many new questions. One example — whether the virus infects myocytes, the cells responsible for heart contractions — “was initially a big issue,” Libby says. Research has since shown that myocytes for the most part escape infection. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 damages the heart indirectly by unleashing inflammatory reactions that affect cardiovascular functioning. Upon invading the body, SARS-CoV-2 latches onto cells studded with receptors that are susceptible to the coronavirus spike protein. The spike protein is key to the virus’s infectivity. Once the spike protein is docked to cell-based receptors, it acts to allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter a cell. Respiratory epithelial cells are considered to be key targets of infection, as are pericytes, which are cells that wrap around capillaries. When infected by the virus, these cells release cytokines that, in turn, act on other cell types that collectively form the interior lining of all blood vessels in the body. This lining, known as the vascular endothelium, “can be thought of as an organ in and of itself,” Lee Lewis says. “The endothelium has a huge job in preventing inappropriate blood clots and allowing blood vessels to constrict and dilate when they normally should.” Normally, the endothelium keeps blood flowing in a liquid state. But when cytokines activate endothelial cells, the cells transition to a defensive posture: they mobilize macrophages and other immune cells and release molecules that promote blood clotting. “Cytokines speak to cells throughout the body,” explains Jeremy Luban, a professor at UMass Chan Medical School who also serves on the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, an HMS-led multi-institutional effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prepare for future pandemics. “And among the cells that may be listening are endothelial cells, which constantly have to monitor for coagulation and tissue damage states and induce actions like clotting to stop bleeding and other measures to prevent harm to tissues.” But blood clots can be lethal. They can, for instance, obstruct arteries feeding the brain. During the pandemic’s early months, arterial blockages were implicated in strokes in numerous patients, even in young people without predisposing risk factors. Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 revealed clots throughout the body and evidence of multiple organ failure. Up to one-third of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were shown to have myocardial injuries that Libby attributes to microvascular clots and endothelial dysfunction, among other conditions. POTS and viral infection Microvascular damage has also been implicated in the long-term symptoms that now constitute a growing focus of COVID-19 research. “Even five months after the acute phase of the illness, we can detect these disturbances,” Libby says. He adds that answers to the mystery of what causes long COVID may be found in microvascular dysfunction. Bruce Levy, the Parker B. Francis Professor of Medicine at HMS and a co-founder of Brigham and Women’s COVID Recovery Center, agrees. The fact that microvessels are present throughout the body, Levy says, might explain why long COVID has been associated with more than 200 symptoms affecting nearly every organ. Brain fog and the confusion and forgetfulness that attends it, for instance, might result from inflammation’s effects on blood vessels in the central nervous system, while long-term cardiovascular symptoms might arise from inflammation in the small vessels leading to and surrounding the heart. A paper that appeared in August 2023 in Nature Medicine reported an extensive analysis of health care data collected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs during a two-year follow-up of veterans who survived the first thirty days of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and data from a control cohort that had not shown evidence of infection. The study looked at risk of death, hospitalization, and pulmonary and nonpulmonary sequelae. Its findings showed that cardiovascular problems sometimes linger even in people who were never hospitalized for COVID-19. Levy, however, points out that severe initial disease is still the best predictor of long-term symptoms. POTS is something that we need to be on the lookout for. Many people suffer with it for weeks or months before getting a diagnosis. Among the more common lingering problems — affecting up to one-third of all patients with long COVID — is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which causes the heart to beat abnormally fast. POTS can be diagnosed if a patient’s standing heart rate test measures a sustained increase of at least 30 beats per minute that persists for ten minutes or more after a patient stands. In many patients with POTS, standing heart rates exceed 120 beats per minute. People who have the condition often feel dizzy, fatigue easily, have trouble exercising, and are prone to fainting. “POTS is something that we as cardiologists, friends, and neighbors need to be on the lookout for,” Lee Lewis says. “Many people suffer with it for weeks or months before getting a diagnosis.” POTS affects up to three million people in the United States, most of them women between the ages of 15 and 50, and often begins after pregnancy, trauma, or a major surgery. A family history of POTS also boosts the risk. But, according to Lee Lewis, POTS cases associated with COVID-19 can affect men or women. At this time clinicians are unsure what the prognosis will be for these patients. How does virally triggered POTS develop in the first place? Mounting evidence points to inflammatory effects on nerves that control blood flow and heart rate. Apart from acting directly on the endothelium, inflammation targets small nerve fibers that dictate when blood vessels should dilate or constrict. Impulses sent through the sympathetic nervous system, for instance, normally tell blood vessels to constrict and the heart rate to increase during standing in order to maintain adequate blood pressure to the brain. However, in people with POTS, the blood vessels may not constrict appropriately. Instead, the heart rate must rise even more than normal to compensate for the “lazy” blood vessels, says Lee Lewis. Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system kicks in when the body rests, instructing blood vessels to dilate and instructing the heart to beat more slowly so the blood pressure goes down. When people stand, blood moves to the lower extremities. To counter this drop, the brain triggers the release of a burst of norepinephrine, which signals the sympathetic nervous system to cause vessels to constrict and the heart to beat faster, moving the blood back to the brain and torso. In someone with POTS, that normal response “gets thrown out of whack,” Lee Lewis says. The vessels don’t constrict and blood stays pooled in the legs, yet the heart rate speeds up and stays elevated. Lee Lewis often works with Peter Novak, an associate professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s and a specialist in long COVID. He describes POTS as one of many dysautonomias resulting from imbalances in the autonomic nervous system, which includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary physiological processes; not just heart rate and blood pressure, but also breathing, digestion, and sexual arousal. Novak estimates that 60 to 80 percent of patients with long COVID have symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, with POTS being the most common. Treatments for long COVID Levy describes long COVID as a post-pandemic pandemic. “Something like sixty-five million people worldwide have been affected,” he says, adding that long COVID profoundly affects people’s ability to work, go to school, or both. The COVID Recovery Center at Brigham and Women’s currently sees up to 150 patients each month and has a waiting list of four to six weeks. About 10 percent of the roughly four thousand patients seen so far were evaluated for cardiovascular problems. But that’s probably an underestimate, Levy says, since patients with POTS and other cardiovascular symptoms are likely to be referred directly to cardiology and not the recovery center for initial evaluation and treatment. According to Anagnostopoulos, therapeutic strategies for patients with long COVID and a POTS-like syndrome or exercise intolerance and tachycardia emphasize light exercise and structured endurance training. The goal is to ward off a “deconditioning spiral” that might cause the original problem to worsen. Similar to POTS, if patients remain sedentary for too long, Anagnostopoulos says, they could develop cardiac atrophy; decreased stroke volume, meaning that the heart doesn’t pump enough blood out of the left ventricle during contraction; or compensatory tachycardia, characterized by resting heart rates that exceed 100 beats per minute. Anne-Marie Anagnostopoulos “It’s important to acknowledge that these patients are suffering,” Anagnostopoulos says. “Many of them are young and unaccustomed to being sick or held back in any way from what they want to do. They often feel they haven’t been taken seriously. And what they want to know is that the doctor sitting with them is developing a plan for improvement.” Anagnostopoulos points to a 2022 report on long COVID in adults by the American College of Cardiology, which cautions against starting treatment for tachycardia or POTS with upright exercise such as power walking or jogging. According to the report, these activities might “worsen fatigue, resulting in post-exertional malaise.” The report’s authors recommend instead a preliminary strategy of recumbent and semi-recumbent exercises, such as stationary biking and rowing, with increasing intensity as a patient regains functional capacity. Researchers are also making headway on how best to approach cardiovascular threats in acutely ill patients with COVID-19. Given a high prevalence of clotting disorders, it might be assumed that anticoagulants and antiplatelet treatments would improve outcomes. But some clinicians caution that bleeding risks from those drugs may outweigh their potential benefits. Advances are also being made in the use of anticytokines, such as glucocorticoids and monoclonal antibodies, to counter systemic inflammation. Libby emphasizes that future trials investigating COVID-19’s cardiovascular effects need to be better coordinated. An initial rush to respond to the pandemic produced a flood of observational and non-randomized studies in this area, he says, which spread more confusion than illumination. Although the pandemic seems to be receding, Luban cautions against complacency. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer and, after declining for years, deaths from heart attack and stroke rose again as SARS-CoV-2 spread worldwide. Fortunately, the virus has not yet evolved to a more virulent form, he says, adding that “it’s heartening that vaccine protection against hospitalization and severe disease seems to be hanging in there. But who knows what will happen? This virus has surprised us every step of the way.” Charles Schmidt is a writer based in Maine.

They dismissed my concerns. A year after recovery, I resumed my routine strenuous exercises, and I noticed I had elevated resting and walking heart-rate and my apple watch would alert me of abnormal heart rates. I went to cardiologists again and they dismissed my concerns again. Both times, they did all the usual battery of tests (Echo, TMT&#x2F;EKG, cholesterol, blood markers etc) and they all came \"normal\". They basically told me stop googling things and to throw away my smart watch. Anyway, another thing my watch was telling was that I wasn&#x27;t getting enough sleep and I focused on fixing that. A few months after that, my resting heart rate started to trend down and has come back to pre-covid levels. I don&#x27;t know what to make of it all. One expensive doctor explained it to me this way – historically medical community don&#x27;t have enough data about how post-infection recovery has been in large populations w.r.t heart rates. Only recently, with smart watches etc such data is available. Until that smart wearable data is scientifically studied, analyzed and concluded, the doctors won&#x27;t change their diagnostics and treatment protocols, for good reason. While I understand that, I felt that their current protocols are for suited for well-advanced and well-presenting cardiac diseases that occur in old people. reply bastardoperator 17 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve lost a lot of faith in medical professionals recently to the point I almost don&#x27;t want to waste time with them unless I really have to. I was having issues with severe pain and tension in all of my movements. My doctor shrugged it off twice, the third time my wife came and she read him the riot act for not taking me seriously. I did a blood test same day and my rheumatoid factors were so off the charts(doctors words) he was surprised I wasn&#x27;t more vocal. Dude, I came to see you two times before, I need to cause a scene in your office to get real care?Then my wife went for hip surgery. We were told it was routine, everything is going to be great, less pain, better range of motion. My wife came out of the ER with the inability to move her leg, drop foot, nerve damage. She went in able and came out disabled. 3 big surgeries later, she can walk again. UCSF doesn&#x27;t want to hear us out on anything related to that botched surgery and the surgeon has since moved to New York.Dealing with medical professionals is like dealing with toddlers.

In some specific metrics such as cancer 5-year survival rates, the USA is consistently at or near the best in the world. In other metrics such as maternal and infant mortality we&#x27;re way behind.

I go to get blood drawn regularly and even with an appointment sometimes the wait is over 90 minutes. There will be people who had an appointment but they were five minutes late so they got put on the walk-in waitlist, which often never gets processed so they sit for hours only to get dismissed. Everything costs too much money and the service is awful. It’s just a nightmare. reply sergiotapia 16 hours agorootparentprevWould you care to share more on how you do this? Do you just fly out and pay out of pocket? How do you find specialists? Curious about this for my mother. reply yetanotherloss 16 hours agorootparentI have permanent residency in Taiwan so it&#x27;s easy for me, although before that it was still easier than anything in the US, just not next to free without their national insurance.I don&#x27;t necessarily encourage medical tourism but simply fly to Taipei, find a doctor you want to see, and sign up for an appointment. It will be a little more work without the NHI card but still probably less than whatever you&#x27;re dealing with. If you get medical scans, almost everyone can print a CD with them in a day or two if you ask. Getting care even without insurance was cheaper than just my US insurance premiums.Having someone fluent in Chinese is important enough I&#x27;d say it was required but if you restrict yourself to a smaller sunset of hospitals and clinics that serve foreigners around like Tianmu you may be able to get by with a translator app.People outside NHI are uncommon and their medical system isn&#x27;t really set up to support it. You may want to consider actual medical tourism facilities of which I&#x27;ve heard of several in Mexico or Costa Rica.You and your mother may also want to consider rioting, because the US system is deliberately and almost uniquely stupid. reply latchkey 16 hours agorootparentprevCheck out Thailand. Medical tourism is a thing. Generally, yes... pay out of pocket, but it is so inexpensive compared with insurance that it isn&#x27;t a big deal.Also, people don&#x27;t realize, you can get health insurance in other countries. Prior to covid, I was an expat living in Vietnam and had very good full health coverage for about $4500 a year. I just found a local insurance broker who did all the paperwork for me. reply pixl97 17 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately this isn&#x27;t a great take either.I&#x27;m not sure what you do, but lets say you&#x27;re a programmer. You love programming and want to make the world better with it. Of course you also have $400,000 in education debt from becoming a programmer and need a job to ensure you don&#x27;t end up bankrupt. So you get a job for $bigCorp that pays well. BigCorp tells you that you must push out 100,000 lines of code per day or you&#x27;re out. You look around and all the jobs in what you do pretty much act the same way, and those bills are coming up at the end of the month. Now, you know you cannot turn out quality code at that rate so you cut back quality to a bare minimum to meet the metrics of continued employment.Most doctors are in a similar situation these days, very few independent offices exist. They are parts of \"GiantHealthCareCorpofAmerica,INC\" that cares far more about how much the shareholders are going to make than how the patents are, even though each individual doctors would like to give better individual patient care. reply sgtnoodle 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not the impression I&#x27;ve developed, having been a software engineer for about 15 years. I think I spent about $100k total, and got a bachelor&#x27;s and a master&#x27;s degree without any subsidies. 400K in student loans for a computer science engineering degree seems pretty steep. That would have to be out-of-state tuition at a pretty nice school. (I suppose we&#x27;ve been in a decade of low interest rates, so perhaps folk have been more willing to borrow a lot more?) I&#x27;ve worked at a BigCorp, and never had lines of code as a performance metric. Lately at my current job, I practically write no lines of code per day, and instead spend most of my time designing solutions to problems and mentoring others. reply pixl97 15 hours agorootparent>400K in student loans for a computer science engineering degree seems pretty steepI did a little adjustment to the numbers in the sense I put them closer to the numbers actual doctors pay for their schooling, not exactly programmer pay. On average doctors pay and programmers pay is very similar. Doctors schooling and programmers schooling is nothing alike at all. Moreso, it&#x27;s far easier to get blacklisted as a doctor then a programmer for any number of reasons (programmer ethics, lol funny). Where you have more risks, more regulations, and more costs the more likely the default behavior becomes to toe the line. reply sgtnoodle 15 hours agorootparentOh, ok yeah 400k of debt seems relatively modest for a medical degree. I didn&#x27;t pick up on your intent to make it a metaphor. reply wyldberry 16 hours agorootparentprevI have a lot of good friends who took the path to be a physician when i opted back into tech.

Discovery and understanding simply takes time. Practicing doctors aren&#x27;t scientists, they aren&#x27;t charged with the responsibility for discovering new disorders and treating them correctly on a per-patient basis. Their job is simply to understand the best available consensus about disorders and treat their patients accordingly. And... it sounds like your doctor did exactly that.And it surely sucks terribly that the understanding was wrong. But that&#x27;s not really the fault of your doctor.

And that&#x27;s being a bad doctor, but it&#x27;s not delivering \"incorrect\" treatment.It&#x27;s basically a converse take to the \"You&#x27;re not wrong, you&#x27;re just an asshole\" meme. reply thenerdhead 16 hours agorootparentCardiologists aren&#x27;t exactly known for their bedside-manner. Also I did present these reputable journals this article alluded to:> As the COVID-19 pandemic was getting underway in early 2020, doctors in Wuhan, China, began to report that many patients hospitalized with the disease had cardiac injuries. Heart attacks were frequent, especially in patients with underlying risk factors, and there were numerous cases of myocarditis, which occurs when the heart’s muscle layers become inflamed. Roughly a quarter of patients with severe COVID-19 had elevated blood levels of troponin, a protein marker for cardiac damage.Still was dismissive of covid having any effect on cardiovascular.

Hydroxychloroquine was being boosted by the same kind of anecdotal evidence). That&#x27;s... just not how medicine works. How do you know which anecdotes are nonsense and which are correct?

Regular exercise will also eventually lower your resting heart rate.

A few months after that, my resting heart rate started to trend down and has come back to pre-covid levels. I don&#x27;t know what to make of it allOf course you know what to make of it all. You were obsessing over the metrics available to you, as many have done as well (myself included), and increased your overall stress levels, bumping your heart rate and making it erratic, and messing up your sleep, which only served to compound it all. You took a year off from strenuous exercise you said, of course it takes time to get your resting rate back down to levels before you were sick and when actively exercising. Imo there is no mystery here. Focusing on your sleep calmed your mind and your body followed suite, combined with the exercise having time to improve circulation and make you more tired to give you better sleep, which helps to lower your overall stress levels, which lowers heart rate, etc, etc.The true question is, did the heart rate elevation cause you any physical issues, or was the issue only that you had visibility into the number. Or put another way, had it not been for 24&#x2F;7 readings of your heart rate, and notifications from your watch, would it ever have manifested itself physically and been something you felt, and noticed. Based on everything starting out with \"my watch would alert me\" or similar, I&#x27;m gonna say if you&#x27;re honest with yourself, had you not had a watch the issue might have come and gone and never been noticed.Edit: here come the downvotes for the crime of claiming some things can be self inflicted esp when it comes to fitbit&#x2F;apple watches. I&#x27;ve watched countless friends and family members fall victim to the obsession of metrics, freaking out about their heart rates all the time, etc. I used to do it myself.

I did measure my heart rate previously though, and the high resting heart rate notifications were new.I was very worried at first because one of my personally prioritized indicators of fitness was how quickly I could go from say, zone 3 to 50bpm. This was quite low, then suddenly I was having 70-90bpm around 30m after exercising.Yet it gradually went away and I never actually experienced discomfort or anything like it. I haven’t seen a high restating rate in around 6 months. I’d say it lasted around a year, in total.I can see why this condition could kill people with pre-existing heart issues or generally poor cardiovascular health.

Not only because it may directly reduce the amount of oxygen in the blood, but also because it creates tons of inflammation and oxidative stress, and that stress seems to affect cells and their energy producing apparatus (mitochondria), causing damages. Those acquired damages inhibit the production of sufficient amounts of energy (ATP). As a consequence, this creates a fertile ground for other pathologies: neurological, cardiac, gastrointestinal, endocrine, autoimmune. In many ways, post-covid is similar to the effects created by beriberi and pellagra diseases.The worst thing is that the incidence of post-covid is hard to predict as it does not depend on severity of the initial disease.

But you can share information that someone might use to protect their health. reply sarchertech 17 hours agorootparentSharing a list of subjective symptoms to “watch out for” so people can “protect their health” isn’t helping anyone.There’s a difference between telling people to talk to their doctor if they have concerns and posting a list of symptoms which is likely to create concern where none of existed. Most of the mentioned symptoms are highly correlated with stress and anxiety. Listing them and encouraging people to pay attention to them is almost certainly doing more harm than good.There is also no widely recognized evidence based treatment for any of this. Advising people to seek treatment is likely going to be completely unhelpful, or worse encourage people to go down some quack rabbit hole and start mega dosing vitamins.Also I’d appreciate if you didn’t imply that cautioning people against posting this kind of medical advice was somehow anti-minority.

It&#x27;s hard to distinguish between the two, and not every doctor is able to do that.As an interesting observation, a metabolic disorder is not responsive to antidepressants alone. reply VancouverMan 18 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I can see, there does seem to be a strong correlation between how much attention one paid to the government and media, and the subsequent attribution of health issues to having tested positive for an infection at some point.Among the people I know and that I&#x27;m aware of, there are three broad groups (spanning age, sex, and numerous other traits):1) People who generally ignored the fear that governments, doctors, and the media tried to instill. They disregarded the lockdowns and other measures imposed by government, and remained calm. They didn&#x27;t take tests, they didn&#x27;t wear masks, they didn&#x27;t get any shots, and they generally went about their lives as best that they could as if nothing was happening.2) People who bought into it, and got somewhat worked up whenever it was pushed by the media. They masked, they stayed indoors when asked to do so, they took tests when they had to, they got shots and maybe boosters, and so on. But once the media focus moved on to other topics, they pretty much forgot about it all and moved on, too.3) People who became extremely paranoid. Some of them masked month after month, even while at home, which they avoided leaving for weeks at a time. They took daily tests. They&#x27;ve taken every shot and booster available. They lived in a constant state of fear for years. Even after most other people moved on, they didn&#x27;t, or in some cases, still haven&#x27;t.The people I know who fall into the first group are consistently doing well, including those in their 70s, 80s, and even a few in their 90s. None have died, and none have had any major medical problems. I know that some of them don&#x27;t even know if they ever contracted it, since they never got tested. If they had it, it was indistinguishable from any other cold or flu.It&#x27;s a mix for people in the second group, although this is a numerically larger group. Some have had major health complications, including cancer and cardiovascular-related issues, but they generally don&#x27;t blame their health problems on having tested positive for infection at some point.The third group are the only ones I hear of attributing ongoing health problems, no matter how minor or common, to a prior infection. Collectively, they now seem to have more serious medical issues, even among those who appeared quite healthy prior to early 2020. Also, I know that a number of these people are repeatedly testing positive for infection, even recently, despite having had numerous shots and boosters, and despite having supposedly overcome one or more prior infections that should have granted some degree of immunity.I can&#x27;t say for sure if it&#x27;s the only factor, but a person displaying more fear&#x2F;paranoia in the past and present does appear to correlate with more medical problems in the present, and a greater likelihood of attributing such problems to having had prior test-indicated infection(s). reply CommieBobDole 17 hours agorootparentUnless you know a really unusually large number of people and are rigorously collecting and verifying data about their conditions, I don&#x27;t know how much value this observation has. It certainly doesn&#x27;t reflect the experience of the people I know, but I&#x27;m not really trying to extrapolate my local experience to the population at large.Also, given that your categories are basically politely-reworded \"Heroes who didn&#x27;t believe the evil lie that Covid is a serious public health problem that we should probably do some stuff about\", \"People who believed the evil lies somewhat but eventually learned the Truth\" and \"Weak paranoid stupid people who bought into all the lies and were consumed by fear and panic as a result\", I&#x27;m going to go ahead and assume that you&#x27;re not really coming at this from a perspective of honest inquiry. reply plagiarist 16 hours agorootparentGiven the overt bias, the only surprising thing about the conclusion is they didn&#x27;t use the phrase \"mass formation psychosis.\" reply garganzol 18 hours agorootparentprevInteresting take.

A cell uses 3 main substrates to produce energy: glucose, lipids, and oxygen. When metabolic rate is low, the brain subconsciously registers that condition and tries to \"increase\" the ATP yield by increasing the amount of substrates in the blood. The glucose concentration gets increased by gluconeogenesis, the oxygen gets increased by hyperventilation. In parallel, increased levels of insulin are produced to increase glucose transport function. The aim of the brain is to satisfy the energy demand, and all those compensatory actions are effective to some degree.However, the cells cannot consume all that glucose despite the massive insulin presence due to a wrecked metabolic machinery of mitochondria, and the body remains hanging in a diabetic, insulin-resistant state of T2DM. If ATP demand is still not met, hyperventilation eventually reaches its peak state, and the individual starts experiencing shortness of breath. If this state of unmet homeostasis lasts for some longer time, the signs of pathological tissue hypoxia start to kick in, causing the appearance of neurological symptoms, which are then followed by metabolic panic attacks (crashes) when left untreated. After that, a more serious cognitive impairment may follow: slurred speech, partial vision loss, problems with spatial navigation, photophobia, etc. All those symptoms correspond to a border-line dementia and may signify the close proximity of a point of no return. reply guythedudebro 19 hours agoparentprevWonder if creatine would have any help with the ATP thing reply lawlessone 19 hours agorootparentPurely anecdotal but I have found creatine gives me more mental energy, even pre covid. reply anjel 18 hours agorootparentNot just anecdotal: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;33578876&#x2F; reply luxuryballs 18 hours agoparentprevthe inflammation seems to be caused by the immune system which makes me wonder if certain things that suppress the immune system can mitigate the damage, almost a catch-22 perhaps reply garganzol 18 hours agorootparentImmunosuppression do help, even its lightest forms such as NSAIDs in small quantities.

But there can be no run-away growth or cancer. 2) infinite capacity for repair: damage cells can always be repaired but a bad instruction can cause run away division and growth and become cancerous.So evolution has to figure out where to turn that knob. Do you want to allow repair at a risk of cancer?Generally things that didn&#x27;t get \"injured\" evolved to reduce repair capacity. Rarely (ever?) do you hear of heart or eye cancer. Those cells just don&#x27;t have much repair capacity. But think of skin. That&#x27;s always getting damaged, so it makes sense for there to be more capacity of repair there at the cost of more cancer.It&#x27;s all tradeoffs. And it can change over (generational) time. Consider a warring population, if people are getting killed younger before they have the time to get cancer, then that population will end up with more capacity for repair because it makes more sense for survival to repair because cancer never gets involved.And the converse can happen, when long life becomes the norm then the tradeoff change and cancer prevention is more beneficial than total repair capacity.Just painting with broad strokes here, it&#x27;s not exact, but a trend that does show up between populations. reply fullarr 19 hours agoprevGone in our minds but forever in our heartsHuh, so covid is more serious than a cold?So you&#x27;re saying that all those scientific studies that prove you wrong with 0 that prove you right actually prove that the vast majority of scientists, pharmacists and medical doctors are \"in on it\"?

One would think we&#x27;d be in a medical age where we stop jumping to psychological conclusions as a way to explain everything and get sick people to retreat into their sad corners.Reality is, its not all that new, is not solely attributable to Covid and there should&#x2F;could have been much more research conducted a long time ago that would&#x2F;could have laid way more ground work instead of researchers coming out with articles years after the fact that just reverberate what many have known all along.Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) overlaps other post viral fatigue syndromes associated with other infections. SARS 2003 also left many with a storm of symptoms that almost perfectly aligned with Long-covid. The infection itself may stem from a different virus or one related, so the onset of the infection, the aggressiveness of the virus, how quickly it peaks and how the immune system reacts, may be different, but many of the sequelas overlap. Many viral infection impact the body differently but devolve into pneumonia for example. So the connection between viral illnesses and ME&#x2F;CFS and&#x2F;or POTS may not be a specific protein, or specific interactions, but the shock to bodies, the response to a viral illness followed by secondary infections. The strain put on the immune system, the inflammation, the cytokine storm, etc.Myalgic encephalomyelitis, also called chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME&#x2F;CFS for short, has been affecting people for a long time. It has been triggered in people after viral infections. POTS risk factors as noted by Hopkins medicine (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hopkinsmedicine.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;conditions-and-diseas...) \"may begin after an apparent or confirmed viral illness, but it can also appear following surgery and other health events.\"ME&#x2F;CFS + POTS (very often comorbid) like chronic illnesses have been cropping up for a long time. Due to the array of symptoms experienced by everyone, its made it hard to differentiate between the combination of potential symptoms and individual symptoms in isolation and the fact that there&#x27;s no single test to diagnose ME&#x2F;CFS. The diagnostic requirements for POTS are much simpler and clear, although a cure is also elusive. There has also been a severe lack of knowledge within the medical community, as these aren&#x27;t resolved illnesses, so patients have been brushed under the rug, misdiagnosed and prescribed treatments which have often been counter productive and even harmful in many events. The complexity of it all and lack of explanations or solutions for patients has frustrated doctors.Lets go back a look at multiple flu epidemics and their long term outcomes.In \"Historical Insight into Infections and Disorders Associated with Neurological and Psychiatric Sequelae Similar to Long COVID\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;33633106&#x2F; they mention \"Historically, the common symptom of altered cognition has been reported during earlier pandemics, which include the influenza pandemics of 1889 and 1892 (Russian flu), the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1919), encephalitis lethargica, diphtheria, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome).\"In \"Lessons from the 1918&#x2F;1919 Influenza Pandemic\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colorado.edu&#x2F;asmagazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;09&#x2F;lessons-19181..., \"Dr. G. Holliday wrote to the British Medical Journal on August 17, 1918, that “mental symptoms were frequent” in the cases he saw; Samuel West informed readers of The Lancet in Feb. 1, 1919, that “the depression which follows influenza is so constant that it ought to be regarded as part of the disease.” The medical correspondent for The Times, having contracted the illness himself, advised readers that “the most distressing symptom was a swift loss of mental capacity and then inability to think coherently.” “All forms of hysteria have been observed after influenza,” reported Thomson and Thomson in 1919,” such as hysterical convulsions and the so-called hystero-epilectic attacks.” “Post-influenzal neurasthenia is very familiar,” they noted, “post-influenzal psychoses” “frequently observed and reported.” They cited a study that asserted that influenza, “of all the infectious diseases . . . is the most likely to be followed by mental disorder.”Note \"Post-influenzal neurasthenia\", or \"an ill-defined medical condition characterized by lassitude, fatigue, headache, and irritability, associated chiefly with emotional disturbance.\". In today&#x27;s medicine, doctors are required to rule all known and understood causes of all your symptoms before coming to the conclusion that you suffer from ME&#x2F;CFS. Thats if you&#x27;re lucky to get a doctor who&#x27;s heard of this and if your doctor had the patience to follow you through all these non conclusive diagnostic tests, all while not defaulting to the simple and all to common medical gaslighting which usually involve telling you its all in your head. Since after all, you&#x27;re complaining of too many things wrong at once, everything seems inconclusive, so you sound a bit off, and mental capacity is most often affected, brain fog being a very common overlapping symptom between all these post viral conditions, and you&#x27;re easy to dismiss. Combine brain fog, uncontrollable fatigue, POTS like symptoms, and patients are more often than not just seen as headcases, hysterical, and a waste of time. If you read stories of patients who are now diagnosed with ME&#x2F;CFS &#x2F; POTS, many have been ill for decades, spent years and years if not decades seeking answers, most of them no longer living among the masses but chronically ill and barely meeting their basic needs day to day, the majority unable to even work. They&#x27;re referred to now as \"millions missing\", and they&#x27;ve been too ill to fight, to ill to be seen, too ill to be recognized.Its not until there&#x27;s pandemics or large groups affected by some viral strain that the media starts talking about a rise in deaths or illnesses that some fringe articles will dig deeper and mention how a subset of people seem to just \"stay sick\" etc, often without relating the similarity between outcomes after other viral illnesses. With Covid having been so impactful and so much money being invested in research, its being talked about quite a bit more now, finally. That being said, it was clear before this even left China that what was to follow would be just as bad as the virus itself. Some people already had \"long-covid\", or post-viral fatigue, or one of the many names that seem to all want to describe these illnesses, and what would seem to be this fresh discovery of \"long-covid\" and all these mysteries left all previous sufferers dumb founded since they had been brushed under the rug and medically gaslit for decades. Its almost like the medical community runs out of time trying to figure it out and eventually moves on and when it comes up again, they slap another title on it and start all over again, often without taking into account every previous instance that could be used as a starting point. Obviously every virus, often every strain, can infect differently and have a different set of primary symptoms, but it should be clear by now that post viral and often chronic conditions, especially after flu like infections, seem to have a definite overlap.I remember watching clips and amateur news coming out of China in early to mid January 2020 and thinking to myself OMG, I hope this doesn&#x27;t spread across the globe. The aftermath is going to be worse than the virus itself. Only reason I instantly thought this is my partner contracted SARS in 2003 and after barely surviving, having spent 2 weeks in the ICU, went on to develop a host of issues including stroke, ME&#x2F;CFS, POTS, and brain fog to just name the main overlapping ones. Having dealt with this for two decades, having exhausted all options available in current medicine, the impact of long-covid or post viral illness has been devastating. It has stripped so many of their lives, it has left so many as dysfunctional shells of their former selves, unable to work or contribute in meaningful ways in their lives, not due to lack of desire or willpower, but a body and mind that won&#x27;t follow. I&#x27;ve seen first hand the struggle of seeing someone fight with everything they have to just be themselves, a person who did what they had to in order to overcome whatever life through at them, but now, the harder they fight, the harder they fall as their bodies reminds them after any amount of effort, exercise, or too much brain work, that they are ill, and they crash, almost as a punishment for even trying to fight, exacerbating many of their symptoms for days, weeks, even months.The long lasting effects of this will not only be those who were lost, but those who now depend on the system and their loved ones, while requiring more medical attention. When its one person, its one thing, when its a percentage of your population, regardless of the whole digit representing that subset, the costs are huge. You&#x27;re talking about a whole percentage of your population who essentially becomes a disabled retiree at whatever age they get ill. Those costs pile up over a lifetime, as does the collective loss of productivity within society. While society will adapt and readjust, it doesn&#x27;t change anything for the millions upon millions who spend the rest of their lives desperately seeking answers, cures, any simple advancement that will give them a piece of their old lives back.alright.. done typing, thanks for coming to my Ted talk. reply randomopining 15 hours agoparentFucoidan solves all of this.

    "title": "Why we don’t generate elliptic curves every day",
    "originLink": "https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/parameters/",
    "originBody": "24 Oct 2023 WHY WE DON’T GENERATE ELLIPTIC CURVES EVERY DAY With all the talk recently of how the NIST curve parameters were selected, a reasonable observer could wonder why we all use the same curves instead of generating them along with keys, like we do for Diffie-Hellman parameters. (You might have memories of waiting around for openssl dhparam to run and then configuring the result in a web server for TLS.) Thing is, user-generated parameters (such as custom elliptic curves) are not safe, and have no significant benefits. This is one of the lessons learned of modern cryptography engineering, and it contradicts conventional wisdom from the ‘90s. Generating parameters is supposed to help with two things: first, it solves the question of how to pick parameters we can all agree on; second, there’s the idea that if we’re all using different parameters we are not putting all our eggs in the same basket and there isn’t a juicy precomputation target for attackers. Picking trustworthy standard parameters is not prohibitively hard[1], and most importantly it is a job for the relatively few people whose job is specifying cryptography, instead of falling on the many many more who use it. Given the opportunity to make some people do a lot of extra work to save a lot of people some work, we should always take it. Not putting all our eggs in one basket is a consideration that might have made sense in a thankfully gone-by era of cryptography when primitives were somewhat regularly weakened and broken.[2] Back then it might have been reassuring that yeah, an attacker might be able to break one key, but maybe they won’t get to break them all, and hopefully the damage will be limited. Today, we consider it completely unacceptable for even a single key to fall to cryptanalysis (as opposed to implementation error or side channel analysis), and we design systems accordingly. For example, device manufacturers embed the same public key in all their devices, and every mailbox user is protected by the same certificate (and really by the same root certificate authority keys), and so on.[3] Even more generally, it’s really not of any consolation to hear that not everyone’s key is broken if your key is broken. Especially when whose key gets broken depends only on who the attacker concentrates their resources on, rather than on random chance. The last time I can remember when custom parameters helped in practice was in 2015, for the Logjam attack. The researchers pointed out that a nation-state attacker could do a large pre-computation to target some very popular 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman parameters. However, the better take away was that 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman ￼was just too weak to be used at all.[4] Also, as we will see later, the custom parameters negotiation introduced complexity that led to the worst parts of the attack. In modern times, if a scheme is so close to the brink of failure that you need to edge by saying that not all keys will fall at once, we just call that broken[5][6]. It could be a corollary of Kerckhoff's Principle, which says that a cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge: A cryptosystem should be secure even if all the parameters, except the key, are shared across every user. Ok, so generating parameters doesn’t help much, but isn’t it better than nothing? No, custom parameters are much worse than nothing. First, it’s usually a very slow process: openssl dhparam 2048 takes more than 17 seconds on my M2 machine, and the docs of dsa.GenerateParameters say This function can take many seconds, even on fast machines. This means it can’t be done on the fly, but needs to be a separate operation handled and configured by the system administrator. Second, and most importantly, verifying the validity of parameters is even harder than generating them. For example, picking a random prime is way easier than adversarially checking if a given number is prime. This adds a tremendous amount of complexity to the security-critical, attacker-reachable hot path. Any degree of freedom given to the attacker is an opportunity to build a better attack, any required runtime check is an opportunity for an implementation bug. There are whole classes of attacks that are just impossible given fixed parameters, such as the 2020 Windows vulnerability that allowed complete TLS MitM and X.509 spoofing by exploiting custom curves[7]. The beauty of that attack is that the parameters weren’t even invalid, but simply controlling the parameters allowed the attacker to fake signatures. On the lower end of the severity spectrum, there’s been a string of DoS vulnerabilities because uncaught parameter edge cases could break expectations of surrounding code and cause crashes or extremely slow operations. This is ultimately a big part of what made DSA much less popular and safe than RSA and ECDSA. ECDSA is not the best signature algorithm, by far, but at least it (usually!) doesn’t require generating and validating parameters. Moreover, when doing negotiation in a protocol, it’s much simpler (and hence safer) to pick between curves A, B, or C or groups 1, 2, or 3 than it is to pick arbitrary parameters. For the former there’s the tried and proven method of having the client advertise support and the server pick. It’s not foolproof and can lead to downgrades without a transcript, but (unfortunately but sometimes unavoidably) most protocols already do many dimensions of parameter negotiation like that. For arbitrary parameters the client expresses some complex or incomplete preferences (if you are lucky), the server produces the parameters, and the client has to check they are valid and compliant with the preferences. For example, the worst part of the Logjam Attack was a downgrade where a MitM convinced the server to pick and sign weak Diffie-Hellman parameters (by requesting “export” cipher suites, even if the client didn’t support them), and then broke them and retroactively fixed the transcript. Had the DH groups been fixed and standardized, the client would have just rejected the unsupported groups injected by the MitM, but instead here the client had to just say “huh, I guess the server really likes these weak parameters, at this point I either go along with it or break the connection”. This hints at an even deeper issue in how DH parameters are negotiated in TLS 1.0–1.2, which is part of why finite field DH is being deprecated in favor of elliptic curve DH[8]: there is no way for the client to express any opinions on the group selection, it can only accept the server’s choice or disconnect, too late in the handshake to select an alternative key exchange. This is also a direct consequence of the lack of standardized groups: with standardized groups the client could have listed the ones it supports, and the server could have refrained from picking DH if there was no acceptable overlap, like ECDH curves always worked. None of these are really intrinsic flaws of the finite field Diffie-Hellman primitive: DH is somewhat less efficient than ECDH, but otherwise perfectly serviceable. The issue is that DH was traditionally specified with custom parameters (groups) while ECDH was almost always specified with standardized curves, so the former ended up much less safe than the latter. Finally, always operating over the same parameters allows implementers to target and optimize code, using tools like fiat-crypto to generate arithmetic code specifically for operations modulo a fixed prime, instead of having to resort to generic big integer libraries, which are necessarily slower and often more complex and not constant time.[9] Fixed fields let us optimize memory allocations, multiplication chains for inversions, low-level carry arithmetic, and so on. An optimized P-256 curve implementation will always be faster than a generic Weierstrass curve implementation, and often safer, too. In conclusion, user generated parameters are a legacy design that proved to be much more trouble than it's worth, and modern cryptography is better off with fixed parameter sets.

Some cryptographers have strong opinions on how to do this: hash a string, nothing-up-my-sleeves numbers, or “rigidly” define requirements and then pick the simplest/lowest value that satisfies them. I think they are all good enough to take away enough freedom from a would-be attacker, such that if the attacker can still select a weak set, they know so much more about the scheme that it might as well be wholly broken. I also find the arguments for why one method is particularly better than the other are weak and any arguments that a method (be it using the digits of Pi or design rigidity) is ironclad seem to ignore the fact that reasonable people will disagree on what is simple, or obvious, or better, or elegant (be it the requirements, or the choice of natural constant and how to encode/use it). It’s worth reflecting on how this is mostly a problem because the NSA poisoned the trust they need to engage in the processes we do need them to engage in. ↩︎ The same era and considerations gave us cryptographic agility, another conventional wisdom from the ‘90s that does more harm than good today. ↩︎ It’s kinda fun to think about what the most precious individual cryptographic key might be. A WebPKI root authority? The Apple firmware signing key? Surely not the DNSSEC root keys. ↩︎ Another way to think about it is that there are in the order of single-digit billions of TLS certificates in the WebPKI, about 2³². This means that if there was an attack that can break one set of parameters, and every certificate used different parameters, the attacker could attack the whole WebPKI by running that attack 2³² times. In that sense, using different parameters is “buying” us only 32 bits of security against full-system compromise (although again, full-system compromise is not the only metric). We generally don’t consider 32 bits a comfortable security margin. Even the Bitcoin network can only perform approximately 2⁹⁴ operations a year, 34 bits less than the conventional 128 bit security level, and that’s a distributed attack that draws a globally noticeable amount of electricity with an extremely simple unit of operation (a single hash). ↩︎ Theoretical cryptographers have an even stricter definition, they call a scheme broken if an attack exists that takes less than brute force, regardless of whether it is practical. I call something broken if it can be attacked in less than ~2¹⁰⁰ parallelizable work with practical amounts of memory. ↩︎ A related shift in wisdom, due to the same dynamic where primitives are not regularly weakened, is the waning relevance of security levels. A scheme is either secure (> 128 bits of security) or not. It’s physically impossible to perform any operation 2¹²⁸ times on Earth, so that’s all you need to rule out brute force attacks. No one targets “higher” security levels if not for compliance or marketing reasons. (There’s an asterisk about multi-user settings and birthday attacks, but really those are special scenarios where you need keys bigger than 128 bits to target a 128 bit security level.) ↩︎ In Go we don’t even parse custom curves in X.509 because oh god why would we, and yet we had to mitigate this because it was possible to target the system verifier through a Go application. ↩︎ TLS 1.3 implements finite-field Diffie-Hellman with standardized groups, but it’s basically unused, since if you’re implementing TLS 1.3 you’re certainly implementing ECDH, too, which is more efficient, so there’s no incentive to add FFDH, even if now it’s properly specified. ↩︎ We still need operations modulo arbitrary primes for RSA, sadly. Thankfully we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to operate modulo odd primes only, which helps a bit. Speaking of RSA, there isn’t really a concept of parameters, but I long believed we should have all agreed to hardcode the e value, and avoided a few DoS attacks, as well as all BB’06 attacks. Hardcoding e saved the signature verification code I wrote a decade ago for youtube-dl, actually. ↩︎ Subscribe to Cryptography Dispatches for more! Subscribe",

I agree with them on the rest, but standard parameters need evidence that they were not specially selected for reasons unknown to everyone else. reply tptacek 16 hours agoparentYou&#x27;re never going to get a satisfactory answer. The world&#x27;s foremost proponent of not trusting standardized parameters wrote and repeatedly submitted a paper demonstrating a model attack that targeted curves built from mathematical constants; when you&#x27;ve \"backdoored pi\", there&#x27;s really no place to go from there.That author&#x27;s subtext, as I understood it, was that curves should be selected by functional optimization; pick the curve parameters that best solve the engineering problems. It was a useful argument given their preferred curve, 25519, which does indeed have a lot of attractive engineering features! But it&#x27;s not hard to see that engineering excellence is a selection principle with even more degrees of freedom than mathematical constants; moreover, you&#x27;re only ever considering optimality at a fixed point in time, but the optimums change over time --- cofactors might be less important when we lack complete additional formulae for a Weierstrass curves, which makes them hard to implement in constant time, but much more important once we do (as is the case now).There&#x27;s really no way around just doing the computer science and cryptological work of working out curve attacks. That&#x27;s the Menezes and Koblitz argument from the \"Enigma\" paper: that the reason to trust the NIST P-curves is that we&#x27;d know by now if they were weak (not because NSA doesn&#x27;t have secret attacks, but because the mechanism by which they were generated would result in whole large classes of broken curves that academic cryptography and mathematics would have caught by now).If you don&#x27;t find Alfred Menezes and Neil Koblitz persuasive surveyors of elliptic curve security, that&#x27;s fine, but my response would be that you can&#x27;t really trust any parameters at all at that point. Certainly, investing trust in the cryptographers best known to the generalist programmer audience seems like a bad alternative strategy. reply nmadden 14 hours agorootparent> cofactors might be less important when we lack complete additional formulae for a Weierstrass curves, which makes them hard to implement in constant time, but much more important once we do (as is the case now).If I remember correctly, part of the reason for the cofactor in 25519 is because Montgomery curves have to have a cofactor and only those curves have the nice x-only Montgomery Ladder, which basically rules out invalid curve attacks (so long as the curve is twist-secure — not all the NIST curves are IIRC). Do the complete addition formulas for short Weierstrass curves also fix this? Invalid curve attacks are a major danger for NIST curves.I know you can use compressed point representation to get the same benefit, but that seems very rare in NIST curve implementations (because old now-expired patents). The landscape of NIST prime-order curve implementations is not great. If all those libraries were going to actually switch to complete addition formulas and compressed public keys then I might feel better about them enjoying a renaissance. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentI agree with you, and am reassured by cryptosystems that use 25519 and put on edge by those that use the P-curves (not because of backdoor conspiracy theories, which are silly, but because the P-curves are easy to mess up).

People believe the NSA may have iterated through the previous ones until they found a vulnerable curve, and NIST recommended that. Take a look:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;this-researcher-says-bitcoins...“(1) The Koblitz curve is specially designed for faster scalar multiplications. Hence the (signing, verifying and key generation) operations on Secp256k1 are faster than those on Secp256r1. (2) Although the Secp256r1 curve was announced to be randomly selected, there could still exist some suspicion that some backdoor might be secretly set up in the curve parameters.

I forgot now whether it was DH or RSA or both, but there was a toy attack where interacting with a peer with super-bad maliciously-chosen parameters can also create an oracle for attacking the same party&#x27;s simultaneous interactions with a third party, if the same secrets are used in both conversations.Sorry for the lack of details, I just totally forget them. I know I did something like this in a CTF, though.A vaguely related example could be that nonce reuse in DSA&#x2F;ECDSA signatures can leak the signing key, so a DSA signer must not allow the other side to choose the nonce. That isn&#x27;t conventionally seen as a \"parameter\", but it&#x27;s easy to imagine that an implementer wouldn&#x27;t automatically assume that it&#x27;s actively dangerous to let the other party choose it. reply tptacek 11 hours agorootparentFamously, small subgroup attacks in DH; I can&#x27;t think of non-silly RSA parameter negotiation bugs (I mean, E=1 with SaltStack, but that doesn&#x27;t really count).

I don&#x27;t think so. Orders of magnitude in brute force are sometimes easier to look at as raw numbers.

Sign in VAS PANAGIOTOPOULOS SECURITYOCT 24, 2023 7:00 AM A Controversial Plan to Scan Private Messages for Child Abuse Meets Fresh Scandal An EU government body is pushing a proposal to combat child sexual abuse material that has significant privacy implications. Its lead advocate is making things even messier. ILLUSTRATION: ARTHOBBIT/GETTY IMAGES Danny Mekić, an Amsterdam-based PhD researcher, was studying a proposed European law meant to combat child sexual abuse when he came across a rather odd discovery. All of a sudden, he started seeing ads on X, formerly Twitter, that featured young girls and sinister-looking men against a dark background, set to an eerie soundtrack. The advertisements, which displayed stats from a survey about child sexual abuse and online privacy, were paid for by the European Commission. Mekić thought the videos were unusual for a governmental organization and decided to delve deeper. The survey findings highlighted in the videos suggested that a majority of EU citizens would support the scanning of all their digital communications. Following closer inspection, he discovered that these findings appeared biased and otherwise flawed. The survey results were gathered by misleading the participants, he claims, which in turn may have misled the recipients of the ads; the conclusion that EU citizens were fine with greater surveillance couldn’t be drawn from the survey, and the findings clashed with those of independent polls. The micro-targeting ad campaign categorized recipients based on religious beliefs and political orientation criteria—all considered sensitive information under EU data protection laws—and also appeared to violate X’s terms of service. Mekić found that the ads were meant to be seen by select targets, such as top ministry officials, while they were concealed from people interested in Julian Assange, Brexit, EU corruption, Eurosceptic politicians (Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage, Viktor Orban, Giorgia Meloni), the German right-wing populist party AfD, and “anti-Christians.” Mekić then found out that the ads, which have garnered at least 4 million views, were only displayed in seven EU countries: the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, and the Czech Republic. At first, Mekić could not figure out the country selection, he tells WIRED, until he realized that neither the timing nor the purpose of the campaign was accidental. The Commission’s campaign was launched a day after the EU Council met without securing sufficient support for the proposed legislation Mekić had been studying, and the targeted counties were those that did not support the draft. The legislation in question is a controversial proposal by the EU Commission known as Chat Control or CSA Regulation (CSAR) that would obligate digital platforms to detect and report any trace of child sexual abuse material on their systems and in their users’ private chats, covering platforms such as Signal, WhatsApp, and other messaging apps. Digital rights activists, privacy regulators, and national governments have strongly criticized the proposal, which the European data protection supervisor (EDPS) Wojciech Wiewiorowski said would amount to “crossing the Rubicon” in terms of mass surveillance of EU citizens.

These Bones Say Otherwise MARYN MCKENNA BUSINESS Amazon Let Its Drivers’ Urine Be Sold as an Energy Drink AMIT KATWALA GEAR Sometimes You Just Need to Lie in a Giant Dog Bed for Humans MEDEA GIORDANO “I think it is fair to say that this was an attempt to influence public opinion in countries critical of the indiscriminate scanning of all digital communications of all EU citizens and to put pressure on the negotiators of these countries to agree to the legislation,” says Mekić. “If the European Commission, a significant institution in the EU, can engage in targeted disinformation campaigns, it sets a dangerous precedent.” The Dutch researcher’s find adds to the controversy surrounding the Commission, which has recently come under fire due to allegations that certain AI firms and advocacy groups with significant financial backing have had a notable level of influence over the shaping of CSAR—allegations that lead Commissioner Ylva Johansson countered, asserting that she had committed no wrongdoing. Johansson’s office did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. “There’s an inexplicable obsession with this file [CSAR] in the Commission. I don’t know where that comes from,” EU lawmaker Sophie in ’t Veld told WIRED after she submitted a priority parliamentary question on the case. “Why are they doing [the campaign] while the legislative process is still ongoing?” As the pressure on the Commission has been mounting, Johansson lashed out against the influential civil rights nonprofit European Digital Rights, one of the strongest critics of the legislation and a defender of end-to-end encryption. She referred to its funding from Apple, suggesting EDRi was laundering the company’s talking points. “Apple was accused of moving encryption keys to China, which critics say could endanger customer data. Yet no one asks if these are strange bedfellows, no one assumes Apple is drafting EDRI’s speaking points,” she noted in a Commission blog on October 13. Referring to EDRi’s independence and transparent funding processes, senior policy adviser Ella Jakubowska tells WIRED: “Attempts to delegitimize civil society suggest a worrying effort to silence critical voices, in line with broader trends of shrinking civic space. When both the content and the process regarding this law are so troubling, we need to ask how the European Commission allowed it to reach this point.” Adding to the Commission’s conspicuous ad campaign, Mekić’s discovery came on the same day the European Commission formally sent X a request for information under the Digital Services Act, the sweeping EU digital disinformation law, following indications of “spreading of illegal content and disinformation” on the platform.

Whilst the DSA is supposed to rein in the power of big tech, the CSA Regulation would force digital service providers to become a privatized police force in all our online chats, emails, and messages,” says Jakubowska. “It’s hard to see how these regimes can coexist or more broadly, how the EU can uphold fundamental human rights if it passes a law which could violate the essence of certain rights.” The votes in the European Parliament and EU Council are still pending. “The Commission seems to forget its own role here: It is not a legislator. It only has the prerogative of proposing legislation,” says in ’t Veld. “It has no business interfering in the internal debate, neither in the Council nor in the European Parliament. The Commission is completely out of bounds here.” Commenting on the negotiations, the outcome of which remains uncertain, EDRi’s Jakubowska observed that “it is reassuring to see that many lawmakers are alert to just how terrifying it would be for the EU to endorse a proposal that in essence amounts to distributed spyware on everyone’s devices.” Science Your weekly roundup of the best stories on health care, the climate crisis, genetic engineering, robotics, space, and more.

As far as the contested ad campaign is concerned, Wiewiorowski, the European data protection supervisor, initiated a pre-investigation requesting from the Commission “information related to the described use of microtargeted ads,” with a response due by the end of last week. Wiewiorowski’s office declined WIRED’s request to comment on the potential for a formal investigation. Ironically, Danny Mekić now believes he’s been shadowbanned by X, alongside other journalists, scientists, and researchers who have been critical of CSAR.

The EU was caught using targeted ads in twitter to get support for a very intrusive law.Smells really bad, but I&#x27;m too cynical to believe that anyone responsible will face consequences. reply eigenket 11 hours agoparentSaying \"the EU\" is wildly oversimplific. A more accurate interpretation (in my opinion) is one particularly stupid EU comissioner (Ylva Johansson, Commissioner for Home Affairs) who is pushing things way beyond her remit.The EU has mechanisms which can deal with this sort of nonsense, however. The comissioners can&#x27;t pass laws themselves, only propose them. The EU parliament has to actually vote the law proposed by the commission into law and it seems unlikely for this one to pass.The EU parliament is directly elected by normal people, and is generally rather more in touch with reality than the commissioners are. reply emptysongglass 3 hours agorootparentI wish we citizens of countries in the EU would stop bending over backward to apologize and explain away these undemocratic institutions. \"Oh but don&#x27;t worry those unelected officials can&#x27;t pass laws, just propose them.\" \"Oh but actually this other body is directly elected unlike these other folks.\" \"Oh it&#x27;s actually democratic because we voted those other folks in who elected them in.\"Like c&#x27;mon folks. It sucks. It&#x27;s really bad. We should do something about it and stop falling all over ourselves to explain how it&#x27;s not that bad. You don&#x27;t think the actual lawmakers are listening to their advice? Of course they are. They elected those proposers.This weird defense we keep rallying to is tiresome. It&#x27;s ok to criticize the EU. It&#x27;s really not a paradise in any sense of the word and many, many of its constituent countries look far less democratic than the US. reply eigenket 53 minutes agorootparentI think you and I mostly agree here.My point is that the EU commission is bad, its a shitty system that doesn&#x27;t work well and needs to be reformed. Pointing at the EU as a whole and saying things like \"The EU was caught...\" lets the commission (and this commissioner) off the hook.If we clearly say that the EU parliament works pretty well, and the commission doesn&#x27;t then its obvious what needs reforming. If you just point at the EU as a whole then the problem looks impossible.By the way I am no longer a citizen of a country in the EU, I&#x27;m from the UK (although I happen to live in the EU currently). reply derelicta 53 minutes agorootparentprevThe european commission is elected, just indirectly. It is proposed by the european council, and the european parliement says yes or no.Saying that indirect elections are undemocratic is like saying Switzerland is not a \"liberal democracy\" because its federal council is elected by the federal assembly instead by direct popular vote. reply happymellon 2 hours agorootparentprev> The comissioners can&#x27;t pass laws themselves, only propose them.Then what&#x27;s the point of them?They are indirectly elected so that they can submit proposals that would normally be political suicide.> who is pushing things way beyond her remitI completely disagree.

Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Palantir, are all mentioned on the wayback machine version of their website as \"tech taskforce\" mebers.

Which is why we should treat it as the smoke and mirrors it is. Just completely ignore their justification and avoid repeating those words on every news report.These politicians couldn&#x27;t give less of a fuck about children. Politics and children do not belong in the same body of text. Finding the words \"child\", \"terror\", \"drug\" and \"money launder\" in any political text is evidence of bad faith and a perfectly valid reason to completely dismiss whatever&#x27;s being said. It&#x27;s almost certain they&#x27;re trying to manipulate people into giving up freedom for false security by appealing to the eternal bogeymen of society.

Extreme left and right wing views are both problematic and there is some validity to LE being unable to track electronic crime due to encryption.Don’t get me wrong, I don’t trust any proposed laws in their current state, but as a society we trust judges to sentence people for crimes, and referees to call foul in sport - I just wish there was the formation of a legitimate ethics committee which would act in good faith on society, because inevitably rights will erode and without one we will be left with less.Edit: I’m sure this will be an unpopular opinion, but I’m interested to hear contrasting thoughts, please vocialize disagreements reply shawnz 13 hours agoparentThere is no objective morality, so any such ethics committee must have to make some trade-offs that are a matter of opinion. We can already mostly agree as a society that protecting civil liberties is more important than having zero crime: otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t have freedom of speech, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, and other things which make it easier to commit crimes. reply geraldwhen 11 hours agorootparentMost of the world doesn’t have freedom of speech.

But more worrying for me is their increasing affinity with lobbying.Many legal systems across the EU explicitly prohibit lobbying not sure why we even allow it in the EU. reply adev_ 9 hours agorootparentExactly.The main problem with the EU is that it is an entity with a construction aborted half-way.The EU parlement is a example of what the EU should be. The EU commission is not.The EU commission was literally intended as a temporary fix for the executive power on the road of a broader European federation.The federarion never happened. And is very unlikely to happen with the PPE (main European conservative party) and the extreme right dominating the political landscape. reply inglor_cz 5 hours agorootparentEuropean federalism is very popular in Brussels, much less so elsewhere. Regardless of the fact that their politicians once signed treaties proclaiming a vague \"ever closer Union\", the nations themselves don&#x27;t want to integrate to the same level as the US did. Any federalization proposal that would be subject to referenda would be shot down in a supermajority of member countries.The current state of things, \"aborted half-way\", is a consequence of social engineering that failed to take into account the possibility that its preferred endgame may not be attractive and that in democracies, going behind the back of the voters can only get you so far.The integration of the EU basically stopped once it became impossible to hide preparation of new treaties and legislation from the voters by distracting people by something else in the media. This is also case of the legislation we are talking about now. Of course the authors of Chat Control 2.0 would prefer to agree to the entire thing in darkness, but the Internet makes it very hard to conceal the plan. reply akira2501 13 hours agoparentprevTo me, the internet should have destroyed the idea of a large centralized federal bureaucracy. The two ideas are almost entirely incompatible. The citizens now have access to each other, their local government, and to world news in a way they never had before. I have a feeling that getting rid of all the large centralized power structures would allow the gift the internet to truly flourish for humanity. reply WinstonSmith84 14 hours agoparentprevhm well, that goes a bit out of topic here. As much as I truly hate to see what the commission is doing, it&#x27;s naive to think that individual countries are just wishing something better for their people. In fact, this legislation may have been promoted by some EU countries. The chance of the EU is that it&#x27;s big enough that 500m people care about it, and that&#x27;s how such things come to light. If it were a random small EU country going full speed to 1984, the chance is much higher that such a legislation would be approved. And then the next country.. all slowly falling like domino reply creer 10 hours agorootparentYes, many not-really in sync countries are a great protection there. And still not effective enough probably.In part there is a lot of group-think overall - which even separate countries have a hard time fighting, when they even notice it or have a will to fight it. For another problem, there are two countries with disproportionate population and economics weight - they cannot outright dictate with impunity but they are in a position to make everyone else negotiate and mostly agree with them. reply colpabar 13 hours agorootparentprevIt seems like it’d be better if one country could go down that path alone, just so the rest of us could point to it as a reminder of why we shouldn’t do the things that it did. The EU makes it so it has to happen to everyone at once. reply creer 10 hours agorootparentYou mean like the UK? The US? India? There are plenty of things that can be pointed out. And few people who will believe it&#x27;s relevant (that&#x27;s not just a US thing) and many people who find it a justification for their own obsession (\"they are doing it, and so should we.\") reply miniBill 14 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m in love with the idea of the EU, that doesn&#x27;t mean that I think any of this is remotely acceptable.And I think that \"it can&#x27;t be allowed to continue\" is a dumb idea reply gosub100 14 hours agoprevDisclaimer: I acknowledge that this is a whataboutism argument.Why not use the phone to detect physical and verbal abuse? The microphone is always on for most users, we have algos that can detect the sound of an adult yelling, a child crying, and the percussive sound of a human hitting another human. If 2&#x2F;3 of those sounds are detected, why not forward that to NCMEC for further review? It doesn&#x27;t have to be \"1 yell, 1 cry, break down the door\", it could be a pattern detector that logs the times, the severity, and the mode. If it hears objects being thrown, people yelling, kids crying, why isn&#x27;t that sufficient to call authorities? How come \"think of the children\" suddenly doesn&#x27;t work anymore?I&#x27;m being 50% facetious here because obviously that&#x27;s a huge privacy issue. But the same logic for CSAM scanning still applies nonetheless. Why only address 1&#x2F;3 of abuse and ignore verbal&#x2F;emotional, and physical? Those kids need justice too. reply rad_gruchalski 12 hours agoparent> Why not use the phone to detect physical and verbal abuse?And adultery!

Ffs. reply eep_social 8 hours agorootparentActually it would be easier and more effective to register every handset and run a check any time two are close together but otherwise isolated.

It&#x27;s almost enough to shatter my faith that people in government are working on my behalf, and make me think they&#x27;re all just hypocrites.

The data show encouraging signs of clinical activity and an increased persistence of cancer-specific CAR-T cells when combined with CARVac. At the ESMO Congress 2023 in Madrid, Prof. John Haanen, M.D., Ph.D., Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), Amsterdam, Netherlands presented the data in an oral late-breaking data session which confirms the positive interim data presented at this year’s American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, USA. “Our goal is to unlock the potential of CAR-T for solid tumors and to help improve the outcomes for a broad range of hard-to-treat tumors,” said Prof. Özlem Türeci, M.D., Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer at BioNTech. “BNT211 aims to address two of the key limitations of CAR-T cell approaches in solid tumors, namely the lack of suitable cancer-specific cell surface targets and the limited persistence of CAR-T cells. To address this challenge, we have designed a CLDN6-specific autologous CAR-T cell therapy that we combine with our mRNA-based vaccine CARVac.” The data update included 44 patients who received CLDN6 CAR-T cells at four dose levels alone or in combination with CARVac. Patients with germ cell tumors (n=16), ovarian cancer (n=17) and other solid tumor types (n=11) were treated. In course of the dose escalation, a dose-dependent increase in adverse events was observed, with cytokine release syndromes occurring in 23 of 44 safety evaluable patients. In most cases, these were of grade 1 and 2, with one patient with a grade 3 and one with a grade 4 event. Neurotoxicity was mild and self-limiting in two patients. Of the total 44 patients, 38 were efficacy evaluable. The overall response rate (“ORR”) for these 38 patients was 45% and the disease control rate (“DCR”) 74%. Further, 27 patients were treated with CLDN6 CAR-T cells at dose level 2 (1x108 CAR-T cells) with or without CARVac. At this dose level, 13 patients showed partial responses resulting in an ORR of 59% and a DCR of 95%. Additionally, in the same cohort, patients who received CARVac showed a prolonged persistence of CAR-T cells. These results further underline the potential of BioNTech’s BNT211 program. One objective of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial is to determine the recommended dose for the initiation of a potential pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with germ cell tumors which is expected to be initiated in 2024. About BNT211 To harness the power of cell therapies for solid cancers, BioNTech has combined their CAR-T and FixVac platform technologies to develop a tumor-specific CAR-T cell therapy which is enhanced by a CAR-T Cell Amplifying RNA Vaccine (CARVac) that is based on BioNTech’s mRNA-lipoplex technology and encodes for the CAR-T target antigen. The mRNA vaccine is designed to boost CAR-T persistence and functionality. BNT211 is a CAR-T cell therapy directed against the novel oncofetal antigen Claudin-6 (CLDN6), a target expressed on multiple solid tumors such as ovarian cancer, sarcoma, testicular cancer, endometrial cancer and gastric cancer. The program is currently being evaluated in a first-in-human Phase 1/2 trial as a monotherapy and in combination with a CLDN6-encoding CARVac in patients with CLDN6-positive relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors.

Wouldn’t that result in killing a lot of those cells? reply Moto7451 16 hours agoparentMy brother made it through CAR-T but ended up succumbing to the effects of a massive tumor that did not respond to the treatment. Essentially all the soft spots and flare ups in his bones went away, but a hard tumor in his abdomen survived. It grew uncontrolled until his kidneys failed.Part of his treatment was “reseting” his immune system with a leukemia regiment to give the CAR-T a fighting chance to augment the native immune system. I don’t think this new CAR-T would affect the treatment plan, especially since CAR-T is generally prescribed after other treatments fail. CAR-T is a little spooky because sometimes it just kills the patient and they don’t know specifically why.The big win here is that in January of this year they told my brother there was nothing they could do to treat the hard tumor. Maybe next January that conversation goes differently. reply spandrew 14 hours agorootparentSorry to hear about your brother passing. Hopefully this gives options in future, as you said. Thanks for sharing reply freeone3000 19 hours agoparentprevYes. This makes it significantly better than most existing cancer treatments, which simply kill all dividing cells, thereby killing cancer faster since it divides faster. (Specific cancers have better treatments, but those treatments are one-per-very-specific-cancer and sometimes -per-cancer-per-person, which is very expensive and limited and not available for all cancers.) This treatment targets a type of cancer that is very hard to treat otherwise, and can actually treat several types of cancer! reply v8xi 18 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s important that the CARVac (mRNA vaccine) part of the treatment targets specifically (though how specific, I dont know) dendritic cells which are \"professional\" antigen-presenting cells in the immune system. During an immune response, dendritic cells gobble up antigens and present them on their surface to help train the immune system so it&#x27;s more trying to hijack that (very important) part of the immune response rather than training the immune system (and resulting in the death of the \"infected\" cells) in the way we&#x27;re used to understanding mRNA vaccines. reply amluto 18 hours agorootparentDoes it target dendritic cells? As far as I know, the mRNA COVID vaccines are rather untargeted and a lot ends up in muscle cells. reply amluto 14 hours agorootparentDownvote all you like, but this has been studied. See, for example, Derek Lowe’s blog:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;blog-post&#x2F;mrna-vaccines-what...Quoting from it: “ And that&#x27;s what you see with the intramuscular dose as well: a good part of the dose goes to the liver, but in that case there&#x27;s a substantial effect in the muscle tissue itself, and it&#x27;s longer-lasting (out to about a week of protein expression)”So, yes, an mRNA vaccine (the current ones, anyway) likely causes a fair amount of Spike protein to be expressed in your muscle tissue, but no one has noticed it causing the death of large amount of muscle tissue [0], and despite some searching, I haven’t found any evidence that anyone really understands what’s going on.[0] People produce cytotoxic lymphocytes that detect bits of spike protein displayed by MHC1, much like CAR-T cells detect whatever they’ve been engineered to target on the surface of cells. Yet CAR-T (sometimes) kills massive numbers of tumor cells, and mRNA COVID vaccines apparently don’t cause the death of massive numbers of harmless cells that took up some of the vaccine. I’m curious why. reply robbiep 14 hours agorootparentIt’s been a while since I’ve been deep in the field, but the basics are you’ve got a first order action and a second order action.T cells in this instance are directly cytotoxic. They find the ligand they bind to, and they begin lysis of the cell to kill it.Meanwhile the intent of the mRNA vaccines that so many of us received over the last several years was to get B cells pumping out immunoglobulins which would soak up virus, reducing severity&#x2F;duration of illness and allowing time for the bodies other defences to swing into action.They’re not the same mechanisms of action (or at least they don’t rely on the same levers at the same strengths). Like everything in the human body, it’s a stochastic process so bits of everything are happening at once reply amluto 12 hours agorootparentRegardless of the intent of the vaccines, the evidence is fairly clear that they induce a CD8+ response, and the manufacturers seem fairly proud of this fact.

This sequence is customized based on the details of the patient&#x27;s particular cancer, but are common across many people. If the cancer has an excess of \"Protein X\" on it, then the CAR sequence is designed to target Protein X. All patients with a similar cancer profile receive the same CAR sequence as a payload to the T cells. This too could be personalized, to not just profile the _class_ of cancer, but particular to that _specific patent&#x27;s cancer&#x27;s profile_ - but this is not yet feasible given the turnaround time to build, test and evaluate a new genetic payload in the context of a person&#x27;s specific tumor cells.This particular therapy has the cells be from the patient (personalized), but the CAR sequence provided to the cells is common for all people that have the same cancer profile (semi-personalized). In this case, the cancer profile includes those that have an abundance of the protein called Claudin-6. reply f6v 19 hours agoparentprevAllogenic CAR T seem to be a thing, but graft vs host hasn’t been figured out yet. reply evantbyrne 15 hours agoprevSomewhat related: I wonder how much next-generation biotech is essentially complete, but waiting in regulatory queues?

But then how different is it from normal cancer treatment? reply dendrite9 7 hours agoparentNot an expert at all but I&#x27;m preparing to go through assisting someone with CAR-T therapy soon. This is just from what I&#x27;ve seen with their treatments and visits so far.In the previous chemotherapy it was dosed at regular intervals and they could make adjustments to the speed of the dose, supplemental medication, and maybe dose size(?) but the close supervision was more or less right around infusion followed by 3 weeks without medical care. With the CAR-T we&#x27;re looking at about a week of 8 hours every day in the clinic, followed by 3 weeks of slightly fewer days each week. In addition the caretakers (family&#x2F;friends) are to monitor the patient at all other times for signs of cytokine release and the neurological effects. There are steroids used to reduce the impact of both but they need to be applied fast enough. The patient is supposed to be monitored 24&#x2F;7 for a month, and for patients who live more than a hour from the clinic they have to stay in a hotel and cannot go home.It seems more serious than the initial chemo cycle but it seems to me that part of that is because they inject the modified cells then just watch. reply KaiserPro 23 minutes agorootparentYeah I had a suspicion that this might be the case for \"normal\" chemotherapy as well.Thank you for this data point, and I wish your family member(forgive my assumption) the very best of luck. reply lawlessone 19 hours agoparentprevIf i&#x27;m dying of cancer i&#x27;d take the risk.

Those who have an organ transplant have to deal recurrence of CMV, EBV and BK virus because they are quite common and latent in the body from past occurrences. I don&#x27;t know if these vaccine will work on me anymore since I&#x27;m already immunosuppressed but there is hope. I&#x27;m dealing with both BKV and CMV right now. Treatment is mostly to cut back on immunosuppressants to let your immune systems fight back but that has its own risks.

However, people took the infamous Israeli study about 94% reduction of risk of asymptomatic infection (hence transmission affecting) at face value (the 5MM people from that study weren&#x27;t swabbed regularly; it was an extrapolation), which meant that some tried to follow the dream of impossible elimination (impossible since March 2020) so they thought everyone needed to be vaccinated. Previous evidence on other CoVs was largely ignored.Second, many vaccinated to go back to a normal life. Imagine the reaction when those people were faced with more lockdowns, masks, restrictions... Some thought they were made fun of.Third, the government officials absolutely hated good news as they thought fear was good to achieve compliance, at least in UK and Italy. In Italy, not the nutjobs, but respected members of medical society unwillingly questioned the efficacy of vaccines (\"half-work\", someone said). This confused the general public even moreFourth, adverse reactions are to be expected and with loads of inoculations, some are bound to appear even if very rare. Even more with these vaccines which are highly reactogenic. The confused reactions on the AZ vaccines when there were cases of thrombosis were eloquent. Also, risk vs benefit ratio was not considered. Children have very low risks but have a higher incidence of (rare) adverse events. Given this, the ratio isn&#x27;t favorable, but it was pushed anyway without solid data (the confidence intervals on FDA documents for pediatric versions of these vaccines are horrid).Fifth, some countries went out of their way to make the lives of those not vaccinating very miserable. In Italy you could not even work without three doses. Children without three doses > 12yo could not take the bus legally. And the whole Canadian truckers matter.While antivaxxers are a very loud but small minority with no real power (they&#x27;re extremists) the whole matter was a massive failure at scientific communication. Also because governments wanted to treat citizens like stupid peasants that needed guidance by the enlightened. Well, not all of them, but in Europe there were many. reply geysersam 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m vaccinated and all.However, it&#x27;s impossible to prove that Covid is more harmful than the vaccine in every particular cohort of a population.Anti vaxxers perceive themselves to belong to a cohort that are less likely to be harmed by the illness, because of youth, behaviour, or physical fitness or luck or religion or whatever.On the other hand, they have plenty of evidence that people belonging to the same cohort have been adversely affected by the vaccine, therefore it&#x27;s entirely logical from their point of view to not get vaccinated. reply peter422 18 hours agorootparentIf that is the standard then I’d say it’s probably impossible to prove anything.I think it’s extremely easy to prove that a covid infection is more harmful than the vaccine in aggregate in every demagogic.Honestly that is probably the case even if you are only counting post-covid symptoms [1].1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;antimicrobial-stewar... reply geysersam 18 hours agorootparentYes I&#x27;d agree that it is impossible to prove something to someone you don&#x27;t share common ground with.

I might however be able to prove the absence of any evidence for the existence of ghosts, provided that the person I&#x27;m speaking to has the same perception of what constitutes evidence. reply CyberDildonics 18 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think the cohort of antivaxxers belongs to a cohort of people that thinks too deeply about what cohort of people they belong to and what cohort of people should take the vaccine vs what cohort of people shouldn&#x27;t take the vaccine. It&#x27;s mostly a cohort of people that want to agree with each other so they can all be in the same cohort. reply cmrdporcupine 18 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s very hard to say, but IMHO the best thing that governments and public health officials could have done (and could do) with this whole scenario is just ... lay off ... on these people once the majority were vaccinated and Omicron came on the scene and the vaccines were shown not to be \"sterilizing\" against it. Putting pressure on past Jan 2022 or so simply became counterproductive.To be clear: I think the vax skeptics&#x2F;opponents were wrong. I&#x27;ve had every one of them I could get as have my kids. And I&#x27;ve still not caught COVID, over 3 years on (or if I did it was so mild as to be undetectable.) I think the vaccines are great.But these people have been backed into an ideological corner, and they&#x27;re behaving like anybody when they&#x27;re cornered. It is now best to back away, because we are now dealing with another kind of contagion because many anti-vaxxers became ripe pickings for formerly unrelated far right, conspiracy type radicalization.I think there are many lessons for public health officials here for future campaigns. reply Lord-Jobo 14 hours agorootparentThere was basically nothing any public official in the US could do to steer the ship in any kind of direction, once the political leader of 75 million Americans had hijacked the entire disease, public health measures to address it, and medical treatments of it, for some pretty over the top and insane political pivoting.The timeline really highlights the volume of avenues he took that damaged the public health apparatus around COVID.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;timeline-of-trumps-covid-1...its no big deal, itll go away soon, i took hydroxychloroquine, masks dont work, \"If we didn’t do testing, we’d have no cases\", stop shutting down, kids with the sniffles are classified as COVID, and a near constant name drop and slamming of Fauci.The guy undermined HIS OWN public health officials constantly and turned them into conspiracy scapegoats. The battle was lost well before the vaccine was even released. What did he think his supporters would do when Fauci came out and said \"take this vaccine\"?

We can’t point a finger at the blob and tell our brain to get its shit together and ignore the cancer’s mimetic countermeasures. We first have to completely understand how cancer and our body works and then invent magical chemicals to force our body to intervene like we rationally know it should reply swatcoder 17 hours agoparentNah, the unique tragedy is that some humans want to live forever in a mushy world where everything complicated will eventually crumble and rot. Cancer has been right there for millions of years and the pretty slick biological \"intervention\" was to just continually be spinning up new generations with a clean slate of cells. It seems to work great on the level of humanity as a whole, and countless tools have been offered to help individuals wrap their head around their individual material mortality. No understanding of cancer or bodies required; no magical chemicals needed; no violated \"shoulds\" involved.That you may now stare at a cancer and panic isn&#x27;t a universal part of \"human existence\", it&#x27;s just a struggle that some individuals see themselves trapped in when they&#x27;ve lost sight of the bigger picture.That&#x27;s not to say that medical inventions aren&#x27;t cool, or that they shouldn&#x27;t be enjoyed, but the starkness of what they&#x27;re set against is a very personal and subjective thing. What&#x27;s tragic is that so many people seem cursed to stare at that darkness these days and lack insight into there even being some very robust alternatives to doing so. reply kelnos 16 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s a little weird to assume that&#x27;s how everything is \"supposed\" to be just because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s been. There&#x27;s really no \"supposed to\"; there&#x27;s what there is, and what we can do and change and build.I do agree that some people take this to far: worrying so much about death that they forget to enjoy life, pouring their lives into life-extension measures and leaving precious little time to live. (Then again, the people who pour their lives into life-extension could end up benefiting countless others; how&#x27;s that for big-picture thinking?) But I&#x27;d hardly call it a \"tragedy\" that humans want to live longer (or even forever).I don&#x27;t particularly fear death, I don&#x27;t think (at least not any more than your average human), but I am supremely bummed out that (assuming humanity doesn&#x27;t destroy itself first) I&#x27;m going to miss out on things like advanced spaceflight, viable long-term colonization of other planets and moons in our solar system, and -- if we can figure out that pesky speed of light issue -- travel to and colonization of other solar systems. And that&#x27;s without getting into more \"out there\" stuff like mind uploading and catoms and whatnot. Humanity has so much potential, and we&#x27;re still a childishly young species that has so much room to grow. To me, the tragedy is that I won&#x27;t get to see what happens with all that.I think the bottom line is that we should stop judging people for how they use their time. I&#x27;m sure there are some people who would scoff at some of the things you or I do with our time; who are we to criticize someone for working to lengthen the human lifespan? reply swatcoder 16 hours agorootparentYou responded to a lot of things that I didn’t write and wouldn’t write, but your insights are good at articulating why medical technology and life extension can be so exciting! reply thegrimmest 16 hours agorootparentprevIf your expectations don&#x27;t align with reality, only one of those things are substantially mutable. If this misalignment causes you distress, there&#x27;s only one thing you can do to fix it. It&#x27;s simply unreasonable to be \"bummed out\" that you won&#x27;t get to see the distant future. We&#x27;re biological organisms with all the limitations that implies, and there&#x27;s not any substantial indication that will change anytime soon.

My comment is not pushing back against medical technology, it&#x27;s pushing back against the idea that human existence is somehow damned to be bleak until some fantastical medical utopia arrives and delivers immortality. You can both enjoy life-extending technology and acknowledge the inevitability of death without all that fretting and drama; many do. reply d0odk 16 hours agorootparentMy point is that many people undergoing cancer treatments are trying to avoid having their lives cut short rather than extend them unnaturally. Children with cancer is an example of this, but it applies to adults as well. Dying of cancer before you get to enjoy a full lifespan IS bleak.

Also, ongoing Phase 1&#x2F;2 means that by 5-10 years this therapy may become commercial, the initial target being refractory&#x2F;relapsing tumours as stated in the announcement. It may take some time for the therapeutic target population to be expanded, but this is not a minimal achievement.My view is that this being an autologous therapy (the patient&#x27;s very own leucocytes are being engineered: the entire manufacturing cycle [I speculate 30-50 days] is done for just a single patient), this will be very expensive and probably only covered on an insurance basis in certain countries only. Still better than nothing, and even science has to make money. The real breakthrough will be arriving to heterologous therapies, where healthy donors leucocytes can be engineered and administered to any patient. reply konschubert 19 hours agorootparentIn the next five years, how many people will die of a cancer that this could have prevented? Why do we accept this, and aren’t willing to bring it to market faster? reply epistasis 17 hours agorootparentThis is only one side of the question. There are thousands upon thousands of potential therapies, all with varying degrees of evidence that they work, with varying degrees of match between the available evidence and the true reality of the potential of that therapy.We need some process to distinguish between what works and what doesn&#x27;t work.The question isn&#x27;t merely \"how quickly can we get this one thing to market\" it&#x27;s \"how can we prove that it works as quickly and cheaply as possible, without biasing us to treatments that don&#x27;t actually work, and with giving all options their proper due.\"For a while in machine learning there was a field called \"active learning\" (might still be ongoing?) that was all about how to choose the most informative questions to ask to learn as quickly as possible.We face that same question with cancer therapies. Every patien that is on one trial can not be on a trial for a different therapy, so that&#x27;s one limited resource for how quickly we can learn. But the other limited resource is of course how much we want to spend on validating therapies versus deploying existing, working therapies to a broader group of humans. reply itishappy 18 hours agorootparentprevLiability. This is a perverse incentive structure, but it&#x27;s not an easy problem.If people die due to your inaction, you are not liable.If people die due to your actions, you very much are.Even a minor issue can end up being harmful. If you have a cancer treatment that&#x27;s safe and effective, but you haven&#x27;t fully vetted it and it turns out to be less effective than another available option, then your drug would cause harm.It&#x27;s safer to test these things, otherwise you get sued, go to jail, your company folds, and nobody gets cancer treatments anymore. reply konschubert 15 hours agorootparentThis is my point. We should try to change this. Streamlining clinical trials would be a first step. reply mschuster91 15 hours agorootparentprevI think it should be allowed that, for people with illnesses that end up inevitably fatal in a high percent range, they be allowed to get early access to experimental medication once it&#x27;s passed some sort of verification.Right now, only those very rich have that chance, they pay the pharma companies (and a host of outright quacks)...

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Sign up for Figma Maker Stories Working Well Inside Figma Insights Topics October 24, 2023 Server-side sandboxing: Containers and seccomp Hongyi HuSecurity Engineering Manager, Figma Max SerranoSecurity Engineer, Figma Inside Figma Engineering Security Containers and secure computing mode (seccomp) are sandboxing primitives that offer a lighter weight alternative to virtual machines (VMs). Here we cover the differences between them, and how we use both at Figma to achieve security isolation. Seccomp, short for secure computing mode, can restrict the system calls a program is allowed to make. As a quick refresher, unlike VMs, container isolation happens at the operating system (OS) layer and typically relies on the host’s OS features for security isolation, such as kernel features like namespaces, cgroups, or privilege dropping. While features like image processing and data parsing are core to applications like Figma, they introduce risks that security teams have to mitigate. It’s expensive and unrealistic to prevent security vulnerabilities entirely, so we use server-side sandboxing (also known as workload isolation), which we cover in detail here. We’ve already explored VMs as a sandboxing primitive, so we’ll turn our attention to containers and seccomp and unpack some ways we implement container-level security isolation at Figma. We’ll evaluate container isolation as we did with VMs, mainly considering two security questions: Can a malicious job inside the container break out and affect the host system? Even if it can’t, can it use the container’s permissions to access other systems or otherwise do harm? The container-to-host attack surface Three components—runtime implementation, the OS primitives and interface available to the runtime, and runtime configuration—generally make up the attack surface for a container escape. By default, containers are not automatically secure sandboxes because the level of isolation provided depends very much on these three factors. A kernel vulnerability, a bug in the runtime implementation, and/or a runtime misconfiguration might allow a malicious workload to modify files and execute code on its host. Docker is a platform for running container applications. For example, on Linux-based systems, Docker uses the “runC” runtime, which can make use of kernel features such as namespaces, cgroups, privilege dropping, seccomp, mandatory access control via SELinux or AppArmor, to provide isolation properties. Docker’s runtime configuration manages how such features are used and configured. Unlike commodity VM solutions, containers place a much greater responsibility on the user to correctly configure the desired level of isolation. More control over security configuration also means more room to make mistakes. (“With great power…” as they say.) While many container systems have more secure default configurations than before, which may work for some sandboxing use cases, the responsibility is on the user—you—to check and make the necessary changes. Compromised containers As with VMs, placing a potentially compromised workload in a container is not necessarily sufficient for security. You need to strengthen the container configuration to prevent host takeover, and the overall container infrastructure architecture should limit the impact of a compromised container. For example, one approach could involve containers without mounted network devices, credentials, or access to other data. In this case, you’d place the containers into their own isolated network with an orchestration system to safely pass input into the container and to consume the output through a controlled channel. The seccomp security model nsjail is a commandline tool that leverages Linux namespaces, capabilities, filesystem restrictions, cgroups, resource limits, and seccomp to achieve isolation. firejail is a Set owner User ID (SUID) that allows you to sandbox different processes. As we shared in our introduction to server-side sandboxing, the idea behind seccomp-only sandboxes is that many programs do pure computation, and thus do not need dynamic access to the filesystem or to make network calls at all. For these programs, we can rely just on seccomp to restrict the system calls that they need, ideally limiting the actions they can take to allocating memory, producing output, and exiting. Seccomp is a powerful isolation primitive used in many commonly used applications like Android, Chrome, and Firefox. In fact, seccomp can be combined with containerization to provide robust, multilayered sandbox-focused systems, such as nsjail and firejail. The syscall interface is the interface between a program and the kernel. For the seccomp-only approach, the attack surface consists of two elements: the kernel’s seccomp implementation and system call (syscall) interface, and the allowed list of syscalls. Thus, while the attack surface is far simpler to reason about than with hypervisors or containerization primitives, seccomp-only sandboxes come with significant constraints. It is your responsibility to determine whether your program can be safely isolated just with seccomp and which syscalls are safe, while still enabling your program to function correctly. Often, you’ll need to rewrite your program to not require dangerous syscalls or apply other sandboxing primitives to provide a more robust defense. Identifying which system calls are safe and which are dangerous can get complicated. The original version of seccomp, for instance, allowed only exit, sigreturn, read and write calls, under the theory that truly “pure” compute needed only these to function and that this reduced kernel attack surface enough to be defensible. Unfortunately, many things that engineers consider to be pure compute require more system calls. In particular, writing code without the ability to allocate heap memory is a pretty drastic change in many developers’ working models—and language runtimes, core libraries, or tracing helpers often want to know the current system time. These operations seem innocuous, but every incremental increase in allowed system calls results in extra kernel attack surface to consider. At Figma, we restrict programs to writing output to already-open file descriptors, exiting, allocating memory and fetching the current time—and thus avoiding complex or less well-covered areas of the system such as the filesystem, network and socket management, or the keychain. Engineering considerations In our introduction to server-side sandboxing, we shared some questions for you and your team as you consider different sandboxing solutions and their trade-offs. Let’s evaluate containers and seccomp through that lens. Environment Out of the box, containers tend to provide a more restricted environment compared to VMs. Some programs may not work at all or may require modification to function correctly; for example, if they have specialized hardware, operating system, or rendering requirements. A seccomp-based approach requires workloads to run in a Linux system with kernel support for it. Security and performance While containers and seccomp present security and performance trade-offs, direct comparison is more complicated and nuanced than with VMs. Containers gVisor is an open source sandbox that’s compatible with Linux. Overall, it’s not straightforward to compare the level of security isolation provided by VMs versus containerization. For example, you could argue that the attack surface of a hypervisor is usually smaller than for an OS kernel, or discuss the number of kernel exploits in recent years that would have allowed a container escape. On the other hand, there are bugs that allow a VM breakout without attacking the hypervisor itself, and newer technologies like gVisor can reduce the attack surface available to containers by interposing its own hardened kernel between the OS kernel and the container process. While VMs should overall provide very strong host-guest isolation with few configuration options, typically you’ll still need to bring your own orchestration and contend with higher performance overhead. By contrast, containerization can also provide quite strong host-guest isolation and can provide fine-grained controls to do so, but will require you to correctly configure everything. Also, as with VMs, how fine-grained your security isolation needs to be will affect the performance hit of using containers. It will also impact how much container orchestration you need to build. Generally, setting up and tearing down VMs should result in a lower performance cost than VMs. For example, the startup time of nsjail is typically on the order of small fractions of a second, tens to low hundreds of milliseconds. There is, however, still a long tail of startup times, and initializing a language runtime within the container can take substantially longer. Seccomp Similarly, it’s not straightforward to compare the level of security isolation provided by VMs and containerization vs seccomp only; seccomp heavily depends on the kernel’s syscall interface and the allowlist that you configure. For example, allowing the `ptrace` syscall is not safe on older Linux kernel versions as it can allow a sandbox escape. Overall, it is possible to achieve extremely strong isolation if only minimal syscalls are allowed. Because syscall filtering is cheap, seccomp-only sandboxes can have significantly less performance overhead than hypervisor or container-based solutions. Development costs and friction Containers and seccomp come with a hefty set of development and tuning costs, especially compared to VMs. Containers For adopting container-based sandboxes, there are two major challenges: configuration and orchestration. Compared to VMs, correctly configuring your security boundaries for a container-based sandbox can require much more technical expertise and experimentation. There’s a long checklist of best practices to follow, such as dropping privileges, putting the process in a new Linux namespace, and restricting mount points, to name a few. It’s important to understand what each of these defenses do, and what guarantees they provide (and what they do not). Safely sandboxing a complex program requires a deep understanding of how the program functions and how it interacts with system resources—like which filesystem locations they read from and write to, and which capabilities they need—and how to apply available container features to minimize the available attack surface. You may need to iterate by trial-and-error to arrive at a functional and suitably secure configuration, which can add up to a non-trivial amount of work. Security configuration is only a part of the adoption cost of sandboxing. For both VMs and containers, you may need to build your own system to manage your worker pool, safely input your workload data, and securely extract the output. Seccomp Compared to VMs and containers, which can often be used as a drop-in sandboxing solution, adopting a seccomp-only sandbox requires much more customization. The engineering cost largely depends on how suitable seccomp is for sandboxing your program. To create the seccomp allowlist, you need to either know all possible syscalls that the program can make, or more typically, empirically construct this list by running the program with a tool like `strace` on a representative corpus of inputs to exercise all possible codepaths. Currently, one notable constraint of seccomp is that it can only filter syscall arguments at the top level and can’t dereference pointer arguments or do other more complicated argument processing. Consequently, seccomp can’t selectively filter some syscalls such as `openat` based on the resource being opened because it requires dereferencing a pointer argument. In turn, you may have to rewrite the program to be more amenable to seccomp so it makes all the risky syscalls before doing the dangerous work of processing user input. (We discuss an example of how we did this in RenderServer further below.) Of course, rewriting the program is only an option if you have the source code and may not be feasible for many commodity programs. One other benefit of the seccomp-only approach is that you can typically invoke the sandboxed program directly without having to worry about additional orchestration or plumbing. Maintenance and operational overhead Both containers and seccomp take operational resources, and engineers outside the security team may need to update the program or develop new features for it. While this is less of an issue for containers, seccomp allowlists can be brittle. New program behavior may require adding more syscalls to the allowlist if they don’t significantly increase attack surface or significant rewriting if the new syscalls do add unacceptable attack surface. Also, monitoring and debugging seccomp-only sandboxes can be particularly tricky. Kernel logs will indicate when a process is killed by seccomp and which syscall caused the problem, without providing much more context. It can be laborious and frustrating to debug and reproduce the issue. There are a number of reasons why it might fail: an overlooked syscall in a seldom-used codepath; recently-introduced behavior that requires a new syscall; a system change—like an upgraded library or kernel; an architectural difference between test environments and production; even a very rare instance in which the program was maliciously exploited. Good continuous integration (CI) testing for seccomp can help catch some but not all problems like this early. Container-based sandboxing at Figma At Figma, we now use nsjail for use cases where container-level security isolation is appropriate. But arriving there has been a journey, and we’ve had to evaluate our own set of trade-offs. Using an nsjail sandbox Our primary use case for nsjail is to isolate RenderServer, a server version of the Figma editor written in C++ that we use to provide features like thumbnailing. RenderServer has a complex set of features, leverages Graphics Processing Units (GPU) acceleration to perform rendering, and is used in multiple backend services. When we first thought about how to sandbox RenderServer, we briefly considered Docker, but soon realized that it would add significant upfront development work and complexity. For example, we would need to create a new service that sandboxes the RenderServer binary inside a secure Docker configuration, create an orchestration system to manage the service, and re-architect various services to make a network call to the RenderServer service instead of invoking the binary directly. A separate service might be a reasonable long term investment but didn’t allow us the flexibility to explore different options based on evolving needs. Instead, we adopted nsjail as a drop-in solution so that we could focus our efforts on securely configuring it for our needs. This configuration leverages all of the sandboxing capabilities that nsjail offers. For each user request, nsjail starts a new RenderServer process in a new user, pid, mount, and network namespace with no network access. Nsjail will also restrict the RenderServer process to only be able to access specific filesystem mount points, such as the input file, libraries, and output folder. And of course, nsjail uses seccomp-bpf to enforce a strict list of syscalls. When we first rolled out the sandboxed version of RenderServer to production, good monitoring and feature flag control allowed for a smooth deployment. On initial deployment, we saw a low but still significant number of job errors and after investigation, we observed that many errors were correlated with input files that contained large images and resulted in output files that were exactly 1 MB in size. Very suspicious! It turned out that we had not read the nsjail documentation carefully enough and that by default, rlimit_fsize was set to 1 MB. One quick PR later, our sandboxed RenderServer was functioning normally. Not surprisingly, we also had to update our seccomp allowlist several times during the rollout. We hit very rare codepaths in the complex RenderServer codebase—which serves user traffic at large scale—that we didn’t encounter during testing or internal use. Using seccomp only Eventually, we explored a seccomp-only sandbox approach for certain RenderServer use cases that did not require GPU acceleration both to reduce performance overhead and the complexity of operating nsjail. The main challenge at the outset was that we could not sufficiently restrict RenderServer’s filesystem access with seccomp alone, due to file I/O being spread out in many places across various feature codepaths in RenderServer. Here is a basic example to illustrate the problem: Suppose we want to use RenderServer to help users export their Figma file as an SVG. In this scenario, the risky step that must be sandboxed is the processing of the Figma file, which might contain malicious input planted by an attacker who wants to hack Figma. A combination of RenderServer and various third-party libraries written in memory-unsafe languages, mostly in C++, handle processing. RenderServer will first finish generating the preview image before writing it to an output file. In case RenderServer becomes compromised by the image processing step, we want to apply a seccomp filter before image processing to prevent the compromised RenderServer process from doing malicious things such as opening and reading other sensitive files on the system. However, if we do that—by configuring our seccomp filter to prevent syscalls like openat—RenderServer would stop working correctly because seccomp would also terminate it upon opening other files such as its designated output file. We refactored RenderServer to reorder all file opens so that they occur before any image processing happens on potentially dangerous user input—which was a lot of work. Ultimately, the refactor allowed us to add a restrictive seccomp filter via libseccomp to prevent RenderServer from doing anything else other than read from and write to only resources that it’s allowed to access. This new version of RenderServer is far easier to test and debug, and it runs significantly faster than the previous iteration using nsjail. But, it also introduces constraints on engineers who wish to add new features or improvements to RenderServer. This locks RenderServer into being a single-threaded application, and means we can’t dynamically load fonts or images later in the runtime. Container-based and seccomp sandboxes can be lighter weight solutions for application security isolation but come with important trade-offs for development and maintenance overhead.

It&#x27;s going to take time and effort to implement. reply rollcat 13 hours agorootparent> When it comes to retrofitting something like pledge (or seccomp) into an existing application when you&#x27;ve not developed it and&#x2F;or can&#x27;t easily tell what syscalls are being called then it&#x27;s always a nightmare.Quite the contrary. If the software in question has been written in a remotely sane way, adding some basic pledge restrictions is a matter of adding one line: pledge(\"stdio rpath whatever you need\", NULL) - it usually goes somewhere in main, after setup() but before while(!quit).You can usually figure out the permission set within a few attempts, even without a very good understanding of the internals, as most (sane) programs will do only a couple of things: an httpd needs to accept connections, read static files, write logs, etc; a window manager needs to talk to X11, open font files, etc; of course there are also complex beasts like Chrome but that one has been done as well.The *real* challenge is breaking up a complex program (e.g. a streaming music player) into separate processes that are concerned with just one or two things, e.g. separate process to make requests over the network, a separate one to decode media, another to maintain an on-disk cache, and so on. Placing restrictions on these subprocesses is the easy part; figuring out where to draw these lines is what&#x27;s hard.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.openbsd.org&#x2F;pledge.2 reply Arch-TK 12 hours agorootparentI think realistically most of the things people seriously care about pledging are complex application and server software so yes the point is you run into problems trying to pledge things. Obviously you can come up with the minimum set of things you can pledge pretty quickly to get things working, but that doesn&#x27;t guarantee they will keep working. And you can also be very broad, but there&#x27;s a point at which that doesn&#x27;t gain you much in terms of security (or as much as you may have set out to gain).This reminds me of a situation where I tried to use firejail to isolate this proprietary piece of software, I ran firejail in the \"auto-generate-something-sensible\" mode and then tried running it in that profile. It would just randomly break at that point. I never quite figured this out due to lack of time. I was expecting to be able to roll with an auto-generated profile at first and tighten it later, the actual end result was there was no profile at all.The other issue you run into is getting things which work sometimes and then stop working randomly. Especially when it&#x27;s a large graphical application. It will do something strange when you click a specific button and crash. Now you are annoyed, probably not in the mood to debug this, so maybe you make a note for later. Now you have to recreate the issue under strace, figure out what you need to pledge now, and repeat.Yes, if you&#x27;re trying to pledge ls, it&#x27;s pretty easy. If you&#x27;re trying to pledge anything non-trivial (i.e. anything which would _really_ benefit from these security restrictions) you end up iterating a lot.It&#x27;s not very fun. reply heroprotagonist 14 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s no tracing tool to build policy with pledge? Seems like an obvious area to add functionality if it doesn&#x27;t exist.Commercial tools have had it for a long time.. even automatic profiling.

You really need to understand the application more than that. Does ls need network sockets? Sure does, if you have yp enabled. But this won&#x27;t appear in your trace unless you trace in such an environment. (Although pledge on openbsd transparently handles this case for you.)2. Just because a program makes a system call doesn&#x27;t mean it should. Or should at that moment. A lot of late initialization can be done earlier for tighter policies. Auto traced policies tend to be extremely broad, permitting too much stuff. reply saagarjha 4 hours agorootparentprevAnd it’s not just your application, too: it’s what you depend on.

Well, one of those companies is firing back, releasing its own study that shows a better safety record than human drivers. Senior Investigative Reporter Bigad Shaban has story. Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco as they shuttle passengers across town, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers? Waymo, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record as one of San Francisco's largest driverless car companies. The findings, described as first-of-its-kind research, make the case that Waymo's driverless fleet is able to steer clear of certain types of collisions at a higher rate than human drivers. “It shows that we’re safe,” said Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices. “We're seeing the fruits of our focus on safety.” Waymo, in partnership with insurance giant Swiss Re, analyzed insurance liability claims in an effort to collect collision data involving both driverless vehicles and human-driven cars. The study utilized 600,000 claims stretching over 125 billion miles to create a \"baseline\" for human driver collisions that could be compared against Waymo's record involving 3.8 million miles traveled without a human in the driver's seat. Attempting to draw fair comparisons between the safety record of driverless cars versus human drivers is a complex feat that has repeatedly proven difficult for the autonomous vehicle industry, according to experts. “The kind of reporting that is used in insurance is much more standardized than any other kind of collision data that you have around,” said Luigi Di Lillo, Head of Products and Partnerships for Swiss Re. “The novelty of this study is to connect the insurance claims data to safety directly.” Waymo’s driverless vehicles, which currently operate in San Francisco and Phoenix, experienced 76% fewer accidents involving property damage compared to human-driven cars, according to the study. For every million miles traveled, human drivers filed 3.26 property damage claims compared to 0.78 for Waymo's driverless cars. I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors. Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices “This is an amazing moment,” said Victor, who spoke to the Investigative Unit in his only television interview. “I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors.” Waymo’s main competition is GM’s Cruise, which recently cut its fleet of driverless cars in half at the direction of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles. The DMV announced its request at the same time it revealed it was launching an investigation into Cruise’s safety record following a series of headline-making accidents, including a collision with a San Francisco fire truck. According to Cruise, its vehicle had a green light when it struck the fire engine, which had its sirens on and appeared to be en route to an emergency scene. Following the state's request to reduce Cruise's fleet, a company spokesperson provided NBC Bay Area with a statement, noting \"Cruise positively impacts overall road safety,\" adding that Cruise looks forward to \"working with the DMV to make any improvements and provide any data they need to reinforce the safety and efficiency of our fleet.\" While the DMV continues its investigation, Cruise’s driverless fleet will be capped at 50 cars during the day and 150 cars at night. In August, Waymo told state regulators it possessed a total fleet of 250 driverless cars in San Francisco, of which about 100 are on the road at any given time. Those figures remain largely unchanged, according to a Waymo spokesperson. Just last month, state regulators with the California Public Utilities Commission granted approval to both Waymo and Cruise to expand their ride-hailing services across San Francisco 24/7, with no limits on how many driverless cars they can put on the road. INVESTIGATIVE AUG 9 Driverless car companies seek expansion in SF despite worries tech lacks safety guard rails SAN FRANCISCO AUG 17 San Francisco city attorney files motion to pump the brakes on driverless cars Waymo’s new study also notes the company’s driverless vehicles have not been involved in a single crash resulting in “bodily injury,” however, some critics have questioned whether the cars have been on the road long enough to begin making fair comparisons to human drivers. For example, Waymo’s driverless cars have traveled roughly 4 million miles, but traffic-related fatalities are routinely measured per 100 million miles. Across America's roadways last year, there were 1.37 fatalities for every 100 million miles traveled, totaling 42,795 lives lost in vehicle traffic crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Each year, human drivers log more than 3 trillion miles on the road. “It’s interesting that we were able to show statistical significance with so little data,” Victor said. “That has to do with two things: one is that we have very robust baselines from Swiss Re, and the other is that we have incredible safety performance.” Waymo did not release the raw data it used to come up with its findings, saying that information is “proprietary.” \"The information they released is the results of the study rather than all the details,\" said Steven Shladover, a research engineer with the Berkeley's Institute of Transportation Studies. \"Of course, as researchers, we like to look more at the details and the methods for the analysis.\" Shladover said he was also \"disappointed\" the study grouped its findings for both San Francisco and Phoenix instead of sharing separate data points for each city. While Waymo's study only offered combined figures, it examined different time spans for each city: Waymo's Phoenix data spanned more than four years (March 2019 to Aug. 1, 2023), while Waymo's San Francisco data incorporated less than two years' worth of driving (March 2022 to Aug. 1, 2023), according to a Waymo spokesperson. \"It lumped them all together and those are quite different areas,\" he said. \"I think it would have been more interesting to see a comparison for San Francisco and then a separate comparison for Phoenix.\" Leaders at Waymo and Swiss Re said they plan to eventually submit their study to a scientific journal so that it can be independently reviewed, however, neither company would say when that might happen. “We are targeting the right journal,” said Di Lillo. “I’m very picky on that.” 4:14 A closer look: Waymo releases safety record study Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers? Google’s Waymo, one of the largest driverless car companies in the city, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record. Bigad Shaban has more.

Never owned a car and never plan to. reply DoingIsLearning 3 hours agoparentFor completion. You actually have real driverless public transport systems functioning for many years now with autonomous metro and rail systems across the world.It is obviously a much easier problem to solve due to its constraints.What is interesting to me is that we have completely altered our transport networks to fit the new paradigm of cars +100 years ago, widening roads, asphalting roads, building motorways, parking lots, etc.But somehow anything that comes after must be backwards compatible with this 1950&#x27;s US Detroit vision of the car centric world. reply dathinab 33 minutes agorootparent> to fit the new paradigm of cars1. because they brought major improvements to most peoples everyday live, much more then self driving will2. it fit&#x27;s the wide landscape of the us perfectly2. it was pushed (lobbied) by much much more money then any of the self driving car or public transportation movements today (not just Oil and Car industry but also e.g. military for Tanks)3. it fit the American dream perfectly, everyone can go everywhere, by themself, everyone gets their own house (which in turn is often noticeable far away from city centers so a car is needed) etc.4. it aligned with a society which moved more from compacter communities to wide spread individualism5. the US was growing a lot, this meant a lot of potential for changes7. it aligned with (also in EU) very wide views about what a good future would be and how to get there, e.g. EU cities which grew a ton around 1950 often have (or had) similar problems8. people where not dependent on walking, switching to cars was viable9. it was a powerful tool to shape society in many ways, including for suppressing successful minorities by intentionally routing highways right through the middle of themToday the US isn&#x27;t growing like that anymore nor can people at all in anyway agree anymore in which direction it should be heading wrt. urban planing. A lot of the grate ideas and shows of wealth and prosperity of the 50th have turned into liabilities. People are so dependent on being able to use cars that it has become a liability for the US where they need to make sure the huge majority of their population can at least somehow somewhat afford a car and gasoline for it, not doing so it not an option. But this leads to a chicken egg problem where for solving some problem you need to change how cars a treated but for changing that you need to first fix the problem. So the only option is to slowly do many small changes but at the same time this makes it much easier for Oil and Car lobbies to hinder the most essential changes. reply cipheredStones 1 hour agoparentprevThe fact that someone always makes this sort of comment when driverless cars come up is really weird to me.I&#x27;ve never owned a car, use public transit very regularly, and think the state of it in the US is pretty bad and underinvested in. However, that&#x27;s due to a huge set of systemic factors (political, organizational, spatial, ...) which nobody seems to have made much progress on, and not for lack of trying.Yeah, it would be great if we all had amazing public transit instead of self-driving cars. But self-driving cars are making big advances, and transit isn&#x27;t. In ten or twenty years, self-driving cars might be everywhere, and transit will probably be roughly as bad as it is today. That&#x27;s why people are excited about one and not the other. reply bertil 29 minutes agorootparentThere’s progress because there’s investment. If dozens of billions were poured into public transport, it would improve dramatically.How can I be so so sure? Because that’s what a lot of countries have done, China first among many, and their public transport network has dramatically improved.The main issue is how much the private car industry avoids having to pay for the astounding externalities they generate: pollution, noise, road violence, global warming, microplastic, urban disruption… It’s orders of magnitude more expensive for people around drivers than for drivers. reply throwaway2037 21 minutes agorootparentIt is strange that you chose China! Have you seen how many kilometers of urban freeways they built in the last 30 years? It is crazy. Look at the Beijing ring roads -- a traffic clogged hell space. reply Swenrekcah 1 hour agorootparentprevIt is because one of the go-to talking points for postponing and diffusing support for better transit is the promise of self driving cars that will somehow solve everything.It doesn’t make sense because the traffic jam problem with cars comes not from human drivers but the physics of the car itself, but it is a persistent talking point nevertheless. reply sw104 1 hour agorootparentprevWhere I live in Northern England, buses are (amongst other reasons) mostly hampered in their reliability by delays and cancellations caused by sharing roads congested with cars.Here there&#x27;s an almost palpable attitude of disgust towards using the bus. Almost a me versus the plebs attitude. The car represents the people&#x27;s private island.It would be slightly improved if people moved from tank-like SUVs to smaller cars, even better improved by embracing 1&#x2F;2 seat cars (which will never happen because the design isn&#x27;t conformist, see the Smart Car), and most improved by people putting their ego aside and taking the bus.For a country hitting 2&#x2F;3 of adults being overweight and obese, it may be a perk that public transport doesn&#x27;t provide A-to-B delivery and instead people get a 5 minute walk somewhere in their day.Instead it looks like self-driving cars will win out due to people&#x27;s behaviour. reply a_humean 1 hour agorootparentIn London, which is a much denser city that any in Northern England, that attitude to buses and public transport is not shared. We have had a lot more sustained investment into reliable and affordable public transport.The lack of comparable investment in northern cities is of course not really the fault of the cities in question (London centric institutions, political culture, and voting base power). reply jwhiles 46 minutes agorootparentIn London I personally always try and cycle beucase I know that any bus I get is likely going to be slower because they are continually stuck in car traffic. Especially during rush hours.Annoyingly, the time when I would like to get public transport most is when it rains. And this is also when the public transport becomes slowest and least reliable. reply danw1979 28 minutes agorootparentprevThe state of bus services in York is pretty terrible. Traffic (journey times) is one reason, but frequency is the main problem. We’ve got these huge vehicles turning up at most very 45 minutes (even in rush hour) because, I’m guessing, the cost of the driver prohibits more frequent services.I can’t park my car near my office in town, it’s just too expensive. I mostly cycle the 8km trip, except when the weather is awful.I’m hoping what we actually get are self driving, smaller, more frequent busses ! reply peebeebee 46 minutes agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not people&#x27;s behaviour. It&#x27;s the state of public transport. Lots of delays, dirty seats, crowded spaces, weird smells, hard noises, jerky movements etc etc etc. I&#x27;d be okay if the state would ban cars, and put all that money into extremely well thought out public transport. But that won&#x27;t happen. reply soco 54 minutes agorootparentprevSo let me understand this: waiting stuck in traffic in your car (self-driving or not) is acceptable, but waiting stuck in traffic in a bus is not? reply bluGill 12 minutes agorootparentA bus is already slower than my car because of the need to stop to let others on. Plus a bus is much less likely to take a direct route to where I want to be thus requiring me to go someplace I don&#x27;t want to go just to transfer to a different bus to get there. Finally when I drive i often am on faster roads that a bus wouldn&#x27;t be on because there is nobody else to pick up (unless I transferred to an express bus)Most people, throughout history have had a fixed time budget to get to work. They move if the trip takes more than half an hour. They will not take jobs (or will move) if it is farther away. We see this across civilizations, from hunter gathers following herds to modern people. There are exceptions but they are exceptions. reply hombre_fatal 44 minutes agorootparentprevOf course, because in your personal car you have your own A&#x2F;C, music, comfort, privacy, and agency. A bus really needs its own lane instead of being stuck in traffic with all the other schmucks who refuse to take it, but few US cities have the balls to do it. reply dagw 49 minutes agorootparentprevIn my car I have a comfy seat and can control my environment (noise, temperature etc.) and whom I share the space with. On the bus I&#x27;m often standing and crammed in between dozens of other people. Also the really big problem isn&#x27;t being stuck in traffic on the bus, but being stuck standing in the cold at the bus stop waiting for the bus that is stuck in traffic or cancelled. reply HPsquared 47 minutes agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s the difference between sitting on your couch at home, and sitting on a bench at the train station. reply n2d4 3 hours agoparentprevAs a European, this seems like an impossible feat at this point. It has been tried, but the cities have evolved in a way where this is just unfeasible.EU cities have mostly been built to be dense around train & bus stations. US cities (besides NY) are extremely large, flat, and spread out. Even if you had public transportation, it would be practically impossible to get from A to B because there are no hotspots besides the downtown&#x2F;city center.The concept of a \"car city\" is real. It&#x27;s a vicious cycle that the US entered at some point, and besides rebuilding the cities entirely there&#x27;s not much hope for public transport. reply fodkodrasz 2 hours agorootparentWild idea: maybe they could try to make a pilot project of that in - ironically - the decaying Motor City maybe.Also: the big car mania spilling over from the US to Europe makes driving in European cities&#x2F;roads more and more difficult, as formerly bidirectional parts are now choke points where only a single oversized SUV can fit through at a time. reply worldsayshi 2 hours agorootparentI suspect that if a metro would be built in a large car centric city over time the city would adapt to the metro and become less car centric. But making the economical argument for building the metro in the first place would be very hard. It would pay back over a time scale that capitalist economies hardly consider. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentNo, capitalist economies tax effort and spend it on longer-term things. It&#x27;s democracies where things can be rolled back by the next leader that are the main cause of short-termism.(I don&#x27;t have a better alternative to democracy; just stating that&#x27;s where the flaw is. Well, that and zero incentive to do things well&#x2F;efficiently outside of political kudos). reply Swenrekcah 1 hour agorootparentThings used to work pretty well in capitalist democracies when the capitalists were well regulated and taxed and the demagogues didn’t have unrestricted personal access to the voter base. reply occz 1 hour agorootparentprevU.S cities were rebuilt to accommodate cars, and there&#x27;s no reason they can&#x27;t be rebuilt to undo this damage. reply HPsquared 34 minutes agorootparentUSA has trouble building enough houses as it is, or a single bridge or piece of infrastructure, and you say they can simply rebuild entire cities? reply bluGill 10 minutes agorootparentOver 50 years. reply PinguTS 2 hours agorootparentprevFunfact: San Franscisco has a public transport system in the area where the driverless cars are operating. reply spike021 2 hours agorootparentIt took how many years just to add one new line? reply JimDabell 1 hour agorootparentI believe you are talking about Van Ness BRT.

That&#x27;s a good thing in my opinion. It&#x27;s really shocking to look at pictures taken from the city centre just 30 years ago and see that cars basically were prioritized everywhere, the main shopping street in Newcastle for instance used to be a normal road with cars parked on either side - it hasn&#x27;t been like that for a long time and the city manages just fine. reply lozenge 1 hour agorootparentprevAmsterdam was 2-4 storey apartments with narrow streets, but the streets were taken over by cars. Once enough traffic was removed&#x2F;space reserved for busses, trams and bikes, the public transport was able to effectively serve users.The US has huge areas where each lot must be single family, at least 50% yard, etc. As well as huge parking lots around businesses. Therefore putting the residents much further from the places they need to be. Meaning busses and bikes would need to travel further. They still need to stop at an interval of say, 10 minutes walk, and therefore they&#x27;re slower. Even if you gave them a dedicated lane this would not help.As well, in London I can take a bus and usually access dozens of services at my destination, like food, entertainment, shopping, etc. In the US, a destination might just have one service, and just a few random businesses in walking distance. Again increasing the number of miles travelled. reply n2d4 3 hours agorootparentprevAccording to the article, Amsterdam was still built with bicycles in mind:> At the start of the 20th century, bikes far outnumbered cars in Dutch cities and the bicycle was considered a respectable mode of transport for men and women. But when the Dutch economy began to boom in the post-war era, more and more people were able to afford carsAmsterdam also has 50% higher population density than Los Angeles, despite housing much fewer people. reply komali2 2 hours agorootparentWell fair enough, but I really don&#x27;t think Americans should throw their hands up in the air and say \"we just can&#x27;t do it.\" This is the country that landed a man on the moon after all, it should be a solvable problem. Maybe the Europeans can&#x27;t help with their own experience, but the American solution of \"just add another lane\" is self-evidently unsustainable. Something new is needed. reply n2d4 2 hours agorootparentI agree, but self-driving cars (in the success case) are something new. More safety, less traffic, no more parking. I could see them make the way to Europe too (I&#x27;d love to have Waymos in my rural village, where cars are still common). reply gambiting 2 hours agorootparent>>less traffic, no more parking.These two goals are incompatible. If the idea is that self driving cars don&#x27;t need to park, they can just drive around in circles until needed(which is an absolutely insane idea for a whole number of reasons, but let&#x27;s stick with it for a second), then that will only increase not decrease traffic.>>I could see them make the way to Europe tooI&#x27;ve love to see a Waymo navigate some narrow British roads where there is no road signage and there is no defined priority.Like, this is a real situation encountered on a road here by myself just few months ago, skip to 1:30 to see the interesting bit - I&#x27;d love to hear proponents of self driving cars explain to me exactly what the car would do in this case. Hand over to a remote operator? There is no signal there, sorry.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DO_OsjSRnEU reply oakesm9 2 hours agorootparentNo idea what a driverless car would do, but that VW driver acts like they’ve never reversed in their life… reply n2d4 1 hour agorootparentprevLess traffic and no parking is compatible because there are fewer total cars, as Waymos are shared. reply gambiting 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t see any indication(other than some people on HN saying this) that people would not want to own a personal vehicle anymore just because self driving cars are a thing. Whether the car drives itself or not, people want to have their own personal space. Not to mention the (very common) need for things like child seats which don&#x27;t really work with shared cars. reply n2d4 48 minutes agorootparentWell, that is Waymo&#x27;s plan, which is explicitly a robotaxi, that this article is about. If we were talking about Teslas, the self-driving vision for instance would be different. reply gambiting 14 minutes agorootparentWell yes, let me rephrase that - I don&#x27;t see any indication that people would switch to robotaxis over owning a personal vehicle. I see that now already - it would be cheaper for me to take a taxi(you know, normal human operated kind) to work every day and back than to own my own car. Once you add up the finance payments, insurance, maintanance and fuel, I could easily just Uber every day to work and back and it would actually save me money. I don&#x27;t want to do that though, as I like the flexibility of owning my own car - and that feeling doesn&#x27;t change even with robotaxis. Maybe I&#x27;m an outlier? lozenge 1 hour agorootparentprevIf 60% of people want to travel at 8:30am and they don&#x27;t want to share a vehicle, then there needs to be that many cars and space for them to park.You can park them further away from their destination, this increases traffic massively driving to the parking.As well, if the ride is comfortable then people will be willing to plan longer commutes. An induced demand which increases the number of miles driven and hence traffic. Watching TV in the car is a major appeal of self driving. reply n2d4 44 minutes agorootparentIf at peak time only 60% of people are driving that means we saved 40% of parking space at no traffic cost, even if we just park the cars normally! That is significant.I&#x27;m also convinced that the peak share of vehicles in use is less than 60% at any time of the day and year, but happy to be proven wrong. replyrobertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s simple: just level the US to be as flat as Amsterdam and bikes will be just as viable for a wide enough range of people. replygghffguhvc 2 hours agoparentprevI use Waymos in SF. For every Waymo trip I do maybe 8 e-bike trips and 20 walking commutes. I’ve taken Waymos to BART stations. Waymo has just replaced Uber for trips in SF for me.It would be nice if the city added more BART coverage but it seems unlikely one will ever be added within 10min walk of my house. There is already one 10min e-bike ride, but I’m not comfortable locking my e-bike there.To bus to the BART station is 10min walk + 3min wait avg then 10min on bus.Uber&#x2F;Lyft&#x2F;Waymo will always be part of my commuting solution for where I live. I just happen to find Waymo the more pleasant experience. reply omgJustTest 1 hour agoparentprevAs you point out there are solutions to the problem publicly promoted.I have always understood this double think in two ways:1. The problem needs to make sense to the people who are working on the tech and people who might buy the tech, but it only needs to be and is preferable to be only adjacent to the real value proposition of the tech. This provides opportunities to incrementally capitalize (“businesses don’t make products they make money”) without providing too much value for “too little” money.2. The “I want x” vs “I need x” is a chasm easily bridged by “this is entertaining to me”. Life is small experiences summed together, providing a blank canvas on which people can extrapolate is engaging but mostly wasted time except for a small number of people who can actually change the direction of the tech. It’s fun for people to dream. reply _lex 1 hour agorootparentHey, I want to get in contact with you - you&#x27;re thinking the way I like folks in my company to think, and I want to hire you or do a deal with you.Check my profile and reach out. reply konschubert 41 minutes agoparentprev> I live in a place where public transport already has last mile connectivity and I walk the rest of the way.

For public transportation to be usable it needs to be reachable. This means reliable and save walkways and&#x2F;or bicycle ways to the next bus&#x2F;train station (and having the schedule of trains and busses synced up even if they are from different providers). It also means you shouldn&#x27;t have a massive parking lot directly in the front of the train station (don&#x27;t mean there can&#x27;t be a parking lot, just not in front) and similarAnother problem is the approach to housing the US has, for public transportation to work well (especially wrt. cost) you need to have reasonable compact housing. For example in many EU citices where public transportation is the main transport factors the main used housing unit is a apartment block often something like 2-4 apartments per floor and 3-5 floors where even in the more rural close by city areas houses often have 2 or 3 apartments or if not are in general much smaller then housing in the US (but in many rural areas in the EU cars are the main transport mean, often followed by bicycles for \"short trips to \"close by\" neighbors, restaurants etc.).If you combine that with the fact or how convenient privileged cars are in the US it really strongly favors self driving cars in many places (except some of the quite compact city centers, where cars of any form are a curse and self driving cars won&#x27;t fix that). reply konschubert 39 minutes agoparentprevAs a matter of fact, even places with good public transport, even here in perfect Europe, still have plenty of dangerous, human-driven cars. reply cbsmith 1 hour agoparentprevMost public transit isn&#x27;t driverless, and that&#x27;s actually one of it&#x27;s key negatives.

As a result, whereas the Waymo ODD largely does not include freeway driving, the human database includes miles driven and claims which occur on freeways. Due to variations in collision frequency per million miles between freeways and non-freeways, this may have led to a baseline which may be more conservative than a roadway- matched baseline. reply ra7 6 hours agorootparentFair enough.

Second, this assumes a \"pure democracy,\" which the USA is not for several reasons, first of which is the fact that it&#x27;s representative, second of which is that its representative rations haven&#x27;t been updated in like a hundred years (if they were, there&#x27;d be thousands of members of congress, and California would have over a tenth of them), and finally, because of disenfranchisement through voter roll purges, gerrymandering, and political arrests (such as when ex-con felons in Florida were directly lied to and told they were allowed to vote so as to entrap them into committing the felony of voting as a felon).Anyway we shouldn&#x27;t assume people wouldn&#x27;t vote against taking away the right to drive, if it came with the building out of good public transit infrastructure in return, which is what the USA desperately needs anyway.

They&#x27;re relevant. reply 8organicbits 2 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re approaching a time when people get to choose to drive themselves vs use a self-driving car, and that decision is personal. There&#x27;s a lot of nuance hidden in these statistics. If a self-driving car is slightly safer than drink driving, but otherwise slightly worse than the average sober driver, that&#x27;s relevant to people who never drink. Using a self-driving car would, statistically, lower their personal safety given those assumptions.From another angle, imagine if we could aggressively ban drink drivers from the road, enforce regular eye exams, suspend the licenses of speeders, etc. Currently the lack of alternate transportation options makes these policies unpopular. Banning a driver could make it difficult for someone to commute to work, for example. Banning poor eye-sight could isolate the elderly. It&#x27;s \"too harsh\". If affordable self-driving cars were an option (or damn it... public transit...) then these policies would likely have public support. So there could be a future where the bottom x% of drivers aren&#x27;t allowed to drive. reply Kichererbsen 3 hours agoparentprevsure. but now your sample only contains the outliers of humanity. reply IshKebab 4 hours agoparentprevMaybe, but do you have a way to exclude those humans from life? reply mjburgess 4 hours agoprevCan we get an insurance quote on human drivers operating a taxi service only in those postcodes? reply nielsbot 4 hours agoprevI can imagine this is true--But I&#x27;d be curious to know how Waymo&#x27;s robots compare with the safest human drivers (under similar conditions), not the average of all humans. reply brabel 3 hours agoparentWhile that&#x27;s an entertaining question, why would they care about that when they&#x27;re just trying to determine the price they should charge for insurance? reply alberth 6 hours agoprevI could imagine a situation where the # of minor fender benders is lower, but # of critical&#x2F;fatal type of accidents is higher. reply xnx 9 hours agoprevGood video from Waymo covering these same points here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9-Qu6HNZu8g reply yk 4 hours agoprevAll that shows is, that Google is as happy spouting bullshit about safety as they are at bullshitting about privacy. Seriously, the longer I think about this, the worse it gets.Thing is the structure of the data for traffic accidents is, that we have a lot of data were we don&#x27;t care much and very little about the accidents we care about a lot. We care more about fatalities than severe injuries, more about severe injuries than about light injuries and more about bodily harm than about fender benders. However, the number of events is precisely the opposite, which makes it easy to just swamp the signal we care about with events we don&#x27;t care about as much.> For example, Waymo’s driverless cars have traveled roughly 4 million miles, but traffic-related fatalities are routinely measured per 100 million miles. Across America&#x27;s roadways last year, there were 1.37 fatalities for every 100 million miles traveled, totaling 42,795 lives lost in vehicle traffic crashesThat is, the expected number of fatalities at this point of data taking assuming Waymo&#x27;s self driving cars are comparable to humans is 0. If we assume that rate is ten times the human rate, then the expected number of fatalities observed is still 0. If we assume that they kill people at a 100 times the rate of human drivers, then there is still a decent chance, something slightly worse than 50&#x2F;50, that we didn&#x27;t observe a fatality yet.> “It’s interesting that we were able to show statistical significance with so little data,” Victor said. “That has to do with two things: one is that we have very robust baselines from Swiss Re, and the other is that we have incredible safety performance.”Now this claim is probably true, in the sense of conflating all accidents with accidents we care about. And actually I think that there is a type of accident, low speed collisions when one tries to squeeze past a badly parked car, that is probably a very large part of all insurance claims where computers just should be really good. Computers have a engineered very precise world model and distance sensors all around and don&#x27;t rely on human intuition guided by human impatience to just hope that squeezing past that will just fit. reply tjmc 7 hours agoprevThe comparison against all human drivers is too broad. Typically insurance companies will apply higher premiums to new drivers due to inexperience and a higher likelihood of accidents. It would be better to see comparisons against the safest, most experienced cohort of human drivers. reply hetman 7 hours agoparentWhat&#x27;s the utility of that? Self driving cars are meant to replace all humans, not just the safest ones. reply tjmc 6 hours agorootparentA couple of reasons. First, you could compare a self driving car&#x27;s safety against your own record. I&#x27;ve had a licence since 1988 and never had an accident. I want to compare against that standard. Second, you could get a better idea of the insurance premium against your own. I suspect there will come a day when the premiums are much lower for self driving cars but right now I suspect they&#x27;d be higher due to all the added self driving equipment you&#x27;re insuring as well. reply pseudosavant 5 hours agoprevI&#x27;d never really thought about it, but in a capitalist society like the US, this is how you really determine how safe something is: how much does it cost to insure? reply jillesvangurp 1 hour agoparentIt&#x27;s a better way than gut feelings, confirmation bias, magical thinking, and other ways arm chair experts tend to casually assert or dismiss stuff.Insurers are on the spot financially. If they get it wrong, it comes out of their margins.Ultimately, you need insurance to be on the road. If you cause an accident, the other side will want to see some money. That&#x27;s why insurance is mandatory: to make sure that money is there. The price of the insurance is directly correlated to how likely you are to cause an accident. Insurers use all sorts of criteria, including how young or old you are and how much claims you&#x27;ve made before.Insurers noticing that they get a lot less claims for self driving cars is going to pretty soon lead to price differences for people who still choose to drive themselves. Cars without self driving features are going to be more expensive to insure. Liability with self driving cars vs. manual drivers is also going to be different. reply tfehring 3 hours agoparentprevYep, insurance is really at quantifying and transferring risk. Maybe the best thing about it is that it translates high, unlikely costs in the future into small, certain costs today, and the latter are far easier to respond to rationally and proportionately.As a minor point, there&#x27;s nothing inherently capitalist about it - the largest personal lines auto insurer in the US (like many of the smaller ones) is a mutual company, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t have outside shareholders and functions more or less as a cooperative owned by its policyholders. reply jeffbee 4 hours agoparentprevI don’t see why not. You are outsourcing the question to an organization dedicated to judging risks. reply bullen 3 hours agoprevOf course it is, safer than drunk humans at least.The problem is not safety, it is what happens after many get killed by machines.And what happens to those inside the machine as it kills someone. reply swhalen 5 hours agoprevThere are considerations beyond just comparing the number of collisions. If a human driver causes an accident, they can be held to account through a legal process. If a self-driving car hurts or kills someone, who is held accountable? reply komali2 3 hours agoprevEveryone&#x27;s been crowing about driverless cars today but when I visited SF a month ago and finally witnessed them in action, I was surprised at their poor performance. In the span of just three days I watched them get confused and stop in the middle of 4 way stop sign intersections twice, and at one point as I was crossing an intersection with one waiting at a stop sign, a Cruise vehicle began to slowly inch forward right when I got in front of it. I was curious so I stopped moving to see what it would do, and it suddenly accelerated, swerving around me with maybe a meter to spare as I skipped out of the way (I doubt it would have hit me if I hadn&#x27;t moved, but I wasn&#x27;t going to take the chance).I know I only have anecdotal data but I&#x27;m really interested in returning to SF and fucking with these cars more to see just how \"good\" they really are. I find when you actually stand up for your rights as a pedestrian and bicyclists, vehicles tend to fall into chaotic behavior. At least a self driving car won&#x27;t actively try to run me off the road on purpose (former Houstonian bicyclist), but at the very least they should know to just stop and wait if there&#x27;s some crazy dude standing around in the middle of the pedestrian crosswalk. Maybe beep or something, but not accelerate suddenly and cross within a meter at alarming speed.I did email cruise about the incident with a timestamp and the \"name\" of the car (I think... it was plastered on the door with \"bruschetta\"), they emailed back saying:> I&#x27;m sorry to hear you experienced this. At Cruise we take safety very seriously and this is not the experience we’d like you to have. This issue is being escalated to the appropriate team to be looked into further. Your input is greatly appreciated as we grow our ride-hail service, We appreciate your assistance.Never heard back from them after that. Wish I had recorded it.

Subscribe now Books Life After “Calvin and Hobbes” Bill Watterson’s return to print, after nearly three decades, comes in the form of a fable called “The Mysteries,” which shares with his famous comic strip a sense of enchantment. By Rivka Galchen October 23, 2023 For Calvin and Hobbes, the years never passed—in “The Mysteries,” time’s arrow can’t be missed for a moment.Illustration by Mikel Jaso; Source photograph by C. H. Pete Copeland / The Plain Dealer / AP “Nothing is permanent. Everything changes. That’s the one thing we know for sure in this world,” Calvin says to Hobbes in the first panel of a two-panel strip that ran in more than two thousand newspapers on Monday, July 17, 1995. The two friends are in a wagon, plummeting perilously forward into the unseen—a common pastime for them. Outside the world of the cartoon, it’s less than half a year before Bill Watterson, thirty-seven at the time, will retire from producing his wildly beloved work. “Calvin and Hobbes,” which débuted in 1985, centered on six-year-old Calvin and his best friend, Hobbes, a tiger who to everyone other than Calvin appears to be a stuffed animal. Six days a week, the strip appeared in short form, in black-and-white, and each Sunday it was longer and in color. The second panel of the July 17th strip is wide, with detailed trees in the foreground, the wagon airborne, and Calvin concluding his thought: “But I’m still going to gripe about it.” After retiring, Watterson assiduously avoided becoming a public figure. He turned his attention to painting, music, and family life. He kept the work he made to himself; he gave few, but not zero, interviews. (When asked in an e-mail interview that ran in 2013 in Mental Floss why he didn’t share his paintings, he replied, “It’s all catch and release—just tiny fish that aren’t really worth the trouble to clean and cook.”) Still, now and again his handiwork appeared. He wrote twice about Charles M. Schulz, the creator of “Peanuts,” whom he never met. For the charity of the cartoonist Richard Thompson, who had been given a diagnosis of Parkinson’s, Watterson illustrated three strips for “Pearls Before Swine,” by Stephan Pastis, and also donated a painting for auction. In other words, he came out for the team. In 2014, he gave an extensive and chatty interview to Jenny Robb, the curator of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum, on the occasion of his second show there. Robb asked if he was surprised that his strip was still so popular. “It seems the less I have to do with it, the higher the strip’s reputation gets!” he said. In the interview, he comes across as levelheaded, not egotistical, not very pleased with electronic devices, the Internet, the diminished size of cartoons—and also quietly intense, like the dad figure in the strip, who enthusiastically sets out on a bike ride through heavy snow. As a college student at Kenyon, Watterson spent much of a school year painting his dorm-room ceiling like that of the Sistine Chapel, and then, at the end of the year, painted it back dorm-room drab. The Best Books We Read This Week Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday. My ten-year-old daughter makes a detailed argument (it involves bicycles, ropes, and scratch marks) that Hobbes is indisputably real; millions of us have the more decisively illusory experience of having grown up with Watterson. But we haven’t! Will we be disturbed if, now that time has passed, he has changed? When word came out that Watterson was releasing a new book this year—“The Mysteries,” a “fable for grown-ups,” written by Watterson and illustrated in collaboration with the renowned caricaturist John Kascht—there was more than passing interest. There were also very few clues about the content, save that there’s a kingdom in trouble, living in fear of mysteries. With a different artist, I might interpret this as an enticement, but it seems more likely that Watterson is merely averse to marketing—he did no publicity for his first “Calvin and Hobbes” collection, and fought for years to prevent Hobbes and Calvin from appearing in snow globes, on pajamas, on chip-bag clips, on trading cards. (“If I’d wanted to sell plush garbage, I’d have gone to work as a carny,” he once said.) Yet Calvin and Hobbes are still everywhere, and forever young. Somewhere on the outskirts of Cleveland, their creator is probably irked that his old characters are pouncing into all these reviews of this other endeavor. As Calvin put it, the universe should have a toll-free hotline for complaints. “The Mysteries” is clothbound and black, about eight inches square, with gray endpapers. The title font looks medieval; the text font looks contemporary. Words appear on the left page of each spread: one or two sentences in black, surrounded by a field of white. The images appear on the right, taking up most of the page, framed by a thick black line. Some of the illustrations appear to be photographs of small clay sculptures alongside elements composed in graphite and maybe paint—but the materials aren’t specified. Think Chris Van Allsburg’s “Jumanji” gone darker, crossed with Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis.” The characters, unnamed, are drawn from that strange eternal medieval world of fantasy: knights, wizards, a king; peasants with faces like Leonardo grotesques, wearing kerchiefs or hoods. There are forty-three sentences in total, and one exclamation point. The magic of condensation that is characteristic of cartoons is also here, in a story with a quick, fairy-tale beginning: “Long ago, the forest was dark and deep.” It all sounds rather sombre, but also it doesn’t take long to read it nine or ten times. (The illustrations, slower to process, do much of the storytelling work.) The story is: Unseen mysteries have kept the populace in a state of fear. In response, a king bids his knights to capture a mystery, so that perhaps its “secrets could be learned” and its “powers could be thwarted.” When mysteries are caught, the public finds them disappointing, ordinary. One illustration is of a vender at a newspaper stand, looking askance. Below him are newspapers with headlines such as “So what?,” “Yawn,” and “Boring.” But modern technologies begin to appear: cars, skyscrapers, televisions. Mastering the secrets of the mysteries brought about a lot of technological marvels, and made the people less fearful. Or you might say insufficiently fearful: the woods are cut down, the air becomes acrid, and eventually the land looks prehistoric, desiccated, hostile to life. In one read, “The Mysteries” is a nephew of Dr. Seuss’s “The Lorax.” It’s also kin to the ancient story of Prometheus, a myth we now associate with technological advancements. Prometheus took pity on the struggling humans, and stole fire from the gods to share it with them. And how has that magnificently useful fire gone for the humans? Pretty well by some measures, pretty catastrophically by others. If only humans heeded the warnings within mysteries as well as they followed the blueprints for making Teflon pans and missiles. I don’t think I’ll spoil the plot of “The Mysteries” if I say that the story finds a distinctive and unsettling path to its final three words, which are “happily ever after.” “It’s a funny world, Hobbes,” Calvin says, plummeting again down a hill in a wagon with his friend. “But it’s not a hilarious world,” he says, as they fall out of their wagon. “Unless you like sick humor,” Hobbes says after he and Calvin have both crashed to the ground. Watterson has said, of the illustrations in “Calvin and Hobbes,” “One of the jokes I really like is that the fantasies are drawn more realistically than reality, since that says a lot about what’s going on in Calvin’s head.” Only one reality in “Calvin and Hobbes” is drawn with a level of detail comparable to the scenes of Calvin’s imagination: the natural world. The woods, the streams, the snowy hills the friends career off—the natural world is a space as enchanted and real as Hobbes himself. Enchantment! If disenchantment is the loss of myth and illusion in our lives, then what is the chant that calls those essentials back? An ongoing enchantment is at the heart of “Calvin and Hobbes.” It’s at the heart of “Don Quixote” and “Peter Pan,” too. These are stories about difficult and not infrequently destructive characters who are lost in their own worlds. At the same time, these characters embody most of what is good: the gifts of play, of the inner life, of imagining something other than what is there. If “The Mysteries” is a fable, then its moral might be that, when we believe we’ve understood the mysteries, we are misunderstanding; when we think we’ve solved them and have moved on, that error can be our dissolution. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER La Isla: Women Speak Out After Mass Arrests in El Salvador Calvin offers the means of enchantment for seeing reality properly. This is well illustrated in the June 3, 1995, daily. (The brief black-and-white weekday strips of “Calvin and Hobbes” often feel as whole as the epic Sunday ones.) Calvin is digging a deep hole and Hobbes asks why. Calvin answers that he’s looking for buried treasure. Has he found any? Calvin replies, “A few dirty rocks, a weird root, and some disgusting grubs.” In the final panel, Hobbes: “On your first try??” Calvin: “There’s treasure everywhere!” While rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” comics for this piece, I was surprised that almost all of them were not entirely forgotten. If I saw them on a crowded subway platform, I would recognize them, even after years of separation. Some of the silliest and most untethered of the strips have stayed with me the most: one in which Hobbes repeats the word “smock” again and again, just happy to say it; another in which Calvin writes down, “How many boards would the Mongol hoard, if the Mongol hordes got bored?”—then crumples up the paper. Watterson has written, “Whenever the strip got ponderous, I put Calvin and Hobbes in their wagon and send them over a cliff. It had a nice way of undercutting the serious subjects.” “The Mysteries” doesn’t entirely lack that lightness—the contrast of modern and medieval in the illustrations is often funny—but humor is not its main tool. Reading “The Mysteries” after rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” reminded me of the Brothers Grimm story “The Goblins.” Goblins steal a mother’s child and replace it with a ravenous changeling. When the woman asks a neighbor for advice on how to get her child back, she is told to make the changeling laugh, because “when a changeling laughs, that’s the end of him.” She makes him laugh (by boiling water in eggshells? A trick perhaps lost across the centuries), and the goblins take the changeling away and return her child. She counters tragedy with a deliberate silliness—and it succeeds, even as the dark persists. In that sense, the old strip and the new fable work best, maybe, together. I’m also reminded of the strip in which Hobbes says, “I suppose if we couldn’t laugh at things that don’t make sense, we couldn’t react to a lot of life.” One of the cozy pleasures of “Calvin and Hobbes” is the prominence of the seasons. This was felt even more acutely when the comics appeared daily in the paper, as they did throughout my childhood, when my brother used to call the Sunday comics insert “the intellectual pages.” (Now we both read the nearly comic-free online news instead of the material papers, into which, Watterson has said, “little jokes” were placed as a respite from “atrocities described in the rest of the newspaper.”) In the fall, a leaf pile transforms into a Calvin-eating monster; in winter, Calvin sculpts a snowman swimming away from snow-shark fins; spring is rainy, and in summer the days are just packed. Time hurries along through the year, but the years never pass—a great comfort. In “The Mysteries,” time’s arrow can’t be missed for a moment. Though the story starts in the misty forever-medieval, it quickly javelins forward. By its close, aeons have passed, and the perspective is no longer even earthbound. The book reads like someone saying goodbye. The outcome feels inevitable. Calvin isn’t the only comic-strip character who doesn’t age. The characters in “Peanuts” never grow up, either. Schulz drew the strip for fifty years, and the final strip was published the day after he died. George Herriman drew “Krazy Kat” for more than thirty years, through to the year of his death, 1944. The characters in “Krazy Kat” also didn’t age or really change much: Krazy Kat is a black cat forever in love with Ignatz, a white mouse who serially hits Krazy with bricks, an action that Krazy misinterprets as a sign of love. Watterson has expressed admiration for both Schulz and Herriman. Yet Watterson, after ten years, moved on to other interests. “Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography,” by David Michaelis, makes vivid that no amount of success ever separated Schulz from his sense of himself, carried over from childhood, as a lonely and overlooked “nothing.” In 2007, Watterson reviewed the biography for the Wall Street Journal, and reminded readers that “Peanuts” had as much darkness—fear, sadness, bullying—as it had charm. “Schulz illustrates the conflict in his life, not in a self-justifying or vengeful manner but with a larger human understanding that implicates himself in the sad comedy,” Watterson wrote. “I think that’s a wonderfully sane way to process a hurtful world.” Herriman, born in the nineteenth century in New Orleans to a mixed-race family, often presented himself, in his adult life, as Greek. It would be oversimplifying to say that Herriman’s background fuelled “Krazy Kat,” just as it would be oversimplifying to say that Schulz was forever a Charlie Brown—but it would be delusional to think that the persistent situations and sentiments of those comics weren’t inflected by their makers’ lives. As Krazy Kat put it, in that magic mixed-up Kat language, “An’ who but me can moddil for me, but I!” Watterson must have been working out something in his strip, too. By his own account, he had a pretty nice childhood, with supportive parents and a house that bordered a mysterious wood. It’s possible that Watterson quit because he tired of the demanding work, or because he’d said all he had to say, or because he was worn out by the legal battles over his characters. But maybe he just changed. Growing up is always a loss—a loss of an enchanted way of seeing, at the very least—and for some people growing up is more of a loss than for others. Perhaps part of what drove Watterson, “Ahab-like” by his own telling, back to the drawing board with his boy and his tiger day after day was a subconscious commitment to staying a child. Maybe he chose to stop publishing because, in some way, for whatever reasons, he became O.K. with growing up. In a Sunday strip on April 22, 1990, Calvin’s dad tells Calvin and Hobbes a bedtime story, by request, that is about Calvin and Hobbes. All he does, pretty much, is describe, to his rapt audience, the first part of their actual day. Calvin complains that his dad ends the story too early, that he hasn’t even gotten to lunchtime. His dad says the story has no end, because Calvin and Hobbes will go on writing it “tomorrow and every day after.” The friends are pleased to learn they’re in a story that doesn’t end. Here’s another story, kindred to “The Mysteries,” about a knight who journeys into a dark and unknown wood. The first scene of “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” which is thought to have been written in the late fourteenth century, takes place in Camelot during New Year’s festivities. A good time, with feasting and friends, is interrupted by the arrival of a stranger: a massive knight, whose skin and hair are all green, who is dressed all in green, who is riding an all-green horse. The knight carries a huge axe and makes a strange proposal, in such a way that the honor of the whole court feels at stake. He invites someone to swing at his neck with his axe; in return, he will have a chance, a year and a day later, to swing the same axe at the neck of the volunteer, who ends up being Sir Gawain. The resonance of the story with facing the perils of a dark and unknown wood, of nature itself, is pretty clear. Gawain chops off the head of the Green Knight, who then picks up his head; says, See you in a year; and rides away. Pretty quickly, the feasting and the merry mood return. How, I remember thinking the first time I read the tale, could this possibly end? It’s not satisfying if the Green Knight is killed, or if Gawain is. Maybe both of them die, I supposed. But no. Gawain keeps his word, despite the perilous terms. En route to his meeting with the Green Knight, in the Green Chapel, he tries to behave well with the seductive wife of the lord who graciously hosts him. Then he bravely bares his neck for the terrifying Green Knight—but he learns it was an enchantment! To me, the ending follows from both good behavior and enchantment—good behavior being something Calvin despises, and enchantment being the realm in which he is king. ♦ Published in the print edition of the October 30, 2023, issue, with the headline “Life After Calvin.” New Yorker Favorites In the weeks before John Wayne Gacy’s scheduled execution, he was far from reconciled to his fate.

Calvin and Hobbes.The second most magnificent thing is Calvin and Hobbes was never licensed.The third most magnificent thing is it stopped whilst it was awesome instead of being wrung out for every penny.There&#x27;s no films, no sequels. You can&#x27;t buy a licensed tshirt with Calvin and Hobbes on it. There&#x27;s no licensed merchandise. No one has made it into a live action movie. Calvin and Hobbes are not available this month on MacDonalds cups if you buy a second whopper burger. You can&#x27;t buy plush toys of Hobbes. There isn&#x27;t a Christmas special TV show. Giant balloon figures of Calvin and Hobbes do not appear in city parades.Imagine if Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit had been kept so pristine. reply whartung 9 hours agoparentAll that said, IMHO, having Peanuts characters on MetLife ads, or visiting Camp Snoopy doesn’t cheapen or weaken the original strips.“Merry Christmas Charlie Brown” and “Great Pumpkin” are both pure, done by Schulz rather than handed off. It’s Schulz bringing his work to life how he wanted it done.Did he have Guaraldi music in his head when he created the characters? Dunno. Do you think it really changed them for him? Dunno either, but seems unlikely.I have the 4 volume C & H boxed set. I was there, mostly, reading it daily from the beginning to the end. I’m pretty sure I have the final strip saved from when it was published in a box somewhere. Mad respect for Watterson, his work, his vision.That said, I’d be first in line for a Hobbes doll. I had a pirate Spaceman Spiff sticker on the back of my motorcycle helmet.I don’t think an Opus the Penguin doll had any real impact on Breatheds work, but at the same time he stopped the licensing, so who knows.The work stands on its own. I’ve never read LoTR. I don’t know if it’s impacted how people view the books. I do know that I’ve watched the trilogy at least once a year since its release.Calvin is Calvin. Opus is Opus. Snoopy is Snoopy. And Waterson will do as he likes with his work. I just think his work is stronger than he, perhaps, thinks it is. reply coldtea 3 hours agorootparent>All that said, IMHO, having Peanuts characters on MetLife ads, or visiting Camp Snoopy doesn’t cheapen or weaken the original strips.I&#x27;d say it very much does.The focus on Snoopy itself is when the strip \"jumped the shark\" (here&#x27;s a take, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kotaku.com&#x2F;how-snoopy-killed-peanuts-1724269473 ).Of course Schulz dilluted it decades before the end of the strip, getting all too into repeatition and mass market concessions. reply vasco 3 hours agorootparentIf I write a book and it&#x27;s good, me doing other stuff later, even with the same characters doesn&#x27;t change the original book.You want to feel like the subject is yours, and if it&#x27;s too widespread, lots of people will learn about it, in an \"inpure way\" (scoff, learning about an amazing comic strip in a movie) and so it cheapens it. Only with this \"hipster\" view on things you could say that. I think it&#x27;s impossible to cheapen something without changing it.If the first edition was cool and the second edition changes the language for sensitivities for example, that can cheapen it, because it actually changed it. McDonald&#x27;s offering a toy of a character from the first edition, changes nothing. reply coldtea 2 hours agorootparent>If I write a book and it&#x27;s good, me doing other stuff later, even with the same characters doesn&#x27;t change the original book.Only technically. In that the actual printed words wont change.In how it&#x27;s perceived in the culture, how it&#x27;s read, how new readers relate to its characters, what it&#x27;s seen as the start of, and so on, it does retroactively change the original.Same how the horrendous 8th season of GoT tainted the previous seasons too. Now it&#x27;s a journey to a pointless ending - and many people who haven&#x27;t seen it are unwilling to get into it because they know that. Even someone rewatching the first season, now has a bad taste knowing the later plot of Danny for example, or how various things shown as prominent in the first seasons (the mysterious signs of the deathwalkers, or even the death walkers themselves) play no significant role, or are just skipped over later. reply flir 2 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m reading Good Omens again right now, and I just got to the \"whole damn sea full of brains\" scene, and I keep hearing it in Doctor Who&#x27;s voice. Plus the whole shipping reading from S1&#x2F;S2 kinds bleeds back. reply jl6 1 hour agorootparentprev> doesn’t cheapen or weaken the originalI&#x27;m not a huge objector to the continued outchurn of the Star Wars or Star Trek or MCU franchises, for example, because there&#x27;s an academic sense in which the existence of bad stuff doesn&#x27;t negate the existence of good stuff.BUT...I think restraint and scarcity can make things more special. Food is more enjoyable when we are hungry, absence makes the heart grow fonder, etc..Narratively, it&#x27;s good to leave some questions unanswered. A successful franchise leaves the fans wanting more, but actually giving them more can leave us over-satiated and uninterested.There&#x27;s no more magic or mystery left when every character has had their own mini-series to fully flesh-out every aspect of their arc. reply bugglebeetle 6 hours agorootparentprevThe sweatshops, landfills, and oceans full of Peanuts trash and conspicuous absence of Calvin and Hobbes junk says otherwise. reply WalterBright 8 hours agorootparentprevMy favorite Peanuts ripoff is a ditty from Jeff Gilbert&#x27;s \"Brain Pain\" circa 1989 or so: kids: Trick or treat! kid 1: I got a popcorn ball! kid 2: I got a fudge ball! kid 3: I got a pack of gum! Charlie Brown: I gotta rock! Gawd I miss Jeff Gilbert&#x27;s show. He should have been syndicated nationally, rather than just a local thing. reply boomboomsubban 10 hours agoparentprev>Imagine if Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit had been kept so pristine.I find it unlikely I would have heard about them, my local library was full of books from the 50&#x27;s I had never heard of and was reluctant to read. Seeing the Hobbit cartoon gave me an interest in it that I followed up on in middle school.On that note, the only way most children will hear of Calvin and Hobbes is if their parents were big fans or through the many unlicensed products available. Maybe that&#x27;s fine, but people seem strangely proud that&#x27;s the case. reply ImprovedSilence 9 hours agorootparentEveryone knew about LOTR and read the books before the movies came out. It was in no way some obscure out of print lit, it was both pop and a cult classic, and it was very much front and center of any must read fantasy bookshelf. Hence the wildly profitable movies. reply vidarh 4 hours agorootparent\"Everyone\" very much didn&#x27;t. Most of the people in my life have seen the movies.

Most genre fiction outside of romance, thrillers&#x2F;crime sell ridiculously low numbers.In a 2003 interview, the project manager for Tolkien at Houghton Mifflin, who held the US rights, stated that they had at the time only had two million-copy bestsellers in the company&#x27;s history: The Silmarillion in 1977, and LOTR in 2001 in the runup to the first movie.By 2003 they&#x27;d sold 2 million copies of the one-volume trade paperback in the US.Worldwide, combined sales went from 50 million copies in 2003, already massively boosted by the movies, to 150 million by 2007. In other words: Nearly half a century to get to 50 million, with a significant proportion of those 50 million in the last few years of that period, and then 100 million in the following 4 once the movies were well known.The readers of \"any must read fantasy bookshelf\" are a small enough demographic that if they were the only ones who&#x27;d watch the movies, they&#x27;d have bombed spectacularly. reply coldtea 3 hours agorootparent>\"Everyone\" very much didn&#x27;t.

As is often remarked the nerds won. It seems unlikely that the conventional wisdom about what sells would not have been changed somewhat by this state of things. reply devjab 4 hours agorootparentprevEveryone in a certain generation did, yes. But it didn’t carry over to their children as such, unless you were a member of fantasy communities I think it’s largely positive that you haven’t heard about them. This is obviously anecdotal, but I grew up in the 80&#x2F;90ies, played dnd and was a general fantasy nerd and nobody in our community had read them before the movies. Even after the movies a lot of us never made it through all the running around in the second book, which was a staring point for a lot of us after having watched the first movie. Our younger siblings never got into it, they got into Harry Potter instead. For todays youngsters LOTR is basically non-existent.While anecdotal like I said, none of the “fantasy” stores around my city sell anything LOTR related while some of them have entire floors dedicated to Harry Potter merc.But you’re absolutely right about what we call the 57’ generation. They all ate it right up. Everyone in my parents generation read it during their early university years, and I do mean everyone. reply indigochill 1 hour agorootparentI grew up in a family of fantasy nerds and it still took a while for me to get around to LOTR. My main interest was I vaguely remembered a WIRED interview with the creators of Riven (the sequel to Myst) where they said it was an inspiration. I don&#x27;t remember in what way since the setting is very different, although looking at it now I can see some thematic similarities (a formerly pristine world set on a doomed path by an evil figure with a god complex).Anyway, I did read the trilogy and the Hobbit and held them in high regard. The movies (mainly the Return of the King) actually did _significantly_ \"cheapen\" the idea of the LOTR in my eyes at least because the \"Return of the King\" movie left out plot points that I felt were vital to the message of the books. Primarily that even after the \"big bad\" was defeated, people were still evil (see the Scouring of the Shire). Much like the real-world war that must have inspired Tolkien given his participation in it, it was a major victory to celebrate but nevertheless not the end of every struggle.Tangentially I&#x27;d also say that even the original Harry Potter brand is cheaper than LOTR because although it&#x27;s fun and palatable, it doesn&#x27;t have as much to say about the real world or challenge us in how we live our lives.A major theme throughout the book trilogy had been that everyone, even Gandalf, has a \"shadow\" that corrupts their good intentions, except for hobbits which made them ideal ring bearers since the Ring would twist ambition&#x2F;pride&#x2F;etc to its own ends. It&#x27;s basically a morality play for the post-WW2 generation, where the demons are not just external monsters but internal temptations. The movie trilogy&#x27;s ending was much \"neater\" and also much less true to life.But on the other hand, the RPG \"The One Ring\" does right by the source material by making the shadow a mechanic in the game that mirrors the theme in the books.So LOTR seems like an excellent example of licensing gone both right (The One Ring) and wrong (admittedly the movies weren&#x27;t all bad, but most could probably agree the Hobbit movies did cheapen the source material). reply boomboomsubban 8 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s impossible to say how popular the series would have been in the late 90&#x27;s without the cartoons. It&#x27;d probably still be a fantasy classic, but I never actively searched out the fantasy genre. I read those books because of the cartoons. reply bruce511 5 hours agorootparentIt can be both.LOTR is the gold standard of Fantasy, and if you got anywhere near that, it was always recommended. I grew up in the 70s and 80s, so well after the novels were published, and they were still ubiquitous.Which of course does not negate the introduction that the animated series or movies had on their continued popularity. Each experience can be different. All roads can lead to Rome.I would say that there&#x27;s a reason LOTR remains huge, while C&H is mostly nostalgia by an aging fan base. LOTR reinvents, C&H is locked in a decision point in time.I guess in like 65 years it&#x27;ll enter the public domain and we&#x27;ll see if dome enterprising publisher decides its worth repeating. reply pyuser583 5 hours agorootparentprevLOTR heavily inspired Dungeons and Dragons, especially the earlier versions.That alone guarantees it’s immortality. reply PhasmaFelis 5 hours agorootparentprevIt was the best-known and most influental fantasy fiction on Earth before the cartoons. Anyone with more than a passing interest in fantasy was at least aware of Lord of the Rings.

Decades passing with the only attention refresh being a not terribly well received movie, I suspect that much of the awareness we are prone to take for granted simply does not exist in people who only know the 20th century from hearsay (which brings us back to Watterson I guess, the topic of absent \"attention refresh\").((1) and already established in book form, its radio origins already relegated to fan trivia - it was years after reading the books that I realized that I had actually heard quite a bit of it in radio form before, enjoying it to the point of deliberately tuning in each week, without committing the name of the show to memory.

(The Kalevala was sung, and in works like Egil’s Saga the prose narrative is frequently interrupted to present an intricate poem.) After all, there was a close link between song, poetry, and magic in ancient northern Europe. reply pjscott 8 hours agorootparentprevHuh. That’s exactly the opposite of the impression I got. The books seemed properly solemn when it counted, more so than the movies, and I found that the poems really added to the atmosphere. (I’m particularly fond of the ones sung by Gimli and Galadriel; as sad and wistful as they were, they managed to convey a lot of mood and emotion in just a few carefully-chosen words.) reply bigstrat2003 3 hours agorootparentYeah, I definitely would never describe the prose in LOTR as not serious. In The Hobbit absolutely (and to be fair it was a children&#x27;s book), but not LOTR. One of the things that the book LOTR does best compared to the movies is the prose!For example, compare the book and film versions of the scene in Return of the King when Eowyn confronts (and kills) the Witch-King. In the book it goes like this:\"Then out of the blackness in [Merry&#x27;s] mind he thought that he heard Dernhelm speaking; yet now the voice seemed strange, recalling some other voice that he had known.\"&#x27;Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!&#x27;\"A cold voice answered: &#x27;Come not between the Nazgûl and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.&#x27;\"A sword rang as it was drawn. &#x27;Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.&#x27;\"&#x27;Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!&#x27;\"Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. &#x27;But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Éowyn I am, Éomund&#x27;s daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.&#x27;\"Now compare the movie version of this scene. Obviously there&#x27;s no narration, but the dialogue is significantly compressed and loses all its flavor.\"I will kill you if you touch him!\" \"You fool! No man can kill me!\" (Eowyn removes her helmet) \"I am no man!\"I don&#x27;t blame Peter Jackson for the change. His movies got a lot wrong when adapting the book, but this wasn&#x27;t one of those things. The original dialogue, even if condensed, would not work very well for a movie. But even though the change was necessary, it still reduces the dialogue from something epic (in the literal sense of the word) and beautiful, into just a generic action hero moment. The book version is just so much better.And this is not an isolated incident, either. Throughout the movie trilogy, scenes which were written with beautiful prose in the book have most of their beauty taken away due to the need to write dialogue in a way that works better in a movie. It&#x27;s necessary, for sure! Even so, however, it means that I can&#x27;t agree with the claim that the LOTR movies handle such things better than the book&#x27;s prose does. reply lolive 1 hour agorootparentSame issue with Dune, the movie.

Regardless of whether this was said outright, the logic here seems to be such.Why don&#x27;t we just normalize ex post facto law while we&#x27;re at it?I feel like we all might have gotten a bit lost in the plot here but I will leave you with this quote that I feel corroborates the encapsulation I have presented here:> I tried to vibe with this POV. What&#x27;s wrong with more content? But it really does cheapen the art&#x2F;media you used to adore. Even if you try to ignore it, i.e. you don&#x27;t have to watch &#x2F; read all the Star Trek content that has been produced in the last 20 years, and after picard season 1 I completely checked out of all of it, but it just kind of makes everything you loved seem so empty. It was all about generating positive cash flows...the whole time.And good night to you sir :) reply Obscurity4340 57 minutes agorootparentAlso, historical revisionism anyone? reply Obscurity4340 7 hours agorootparentprev[] replyOfSanguineFire 10 hours agoparentprev> The third most magnificent thing is it stopped whilst it was awesomeThe last couple of years of C&H featured increasing criticism of modern society (e.g. modern art, advertising) that seemed rather grumpy and “old man yells at cloud”. Sure, Watterson stopped before the strip could have gone in an overtly sociopolitical direction like some of its peers, but the strip was no longer quite as timeless and innocent as it had been. reply windowshopping 10 hours agorootparentStrong disagree. Loved every comic from beginning to end and did not observe any such trend. reply WalterBright 8 hours agorootparentprevRocky and Bullwinkle, ostensibly a kiddie cartoon, had quite a bit of sly political humor tossed in (and even sex humor). It would also break the 4th wall now and then.R+B is a forgotten treasure. reply imadethis 8 hours agorootparentIf you visit Wilsonville, OR or Tukwila, WA, you can go to an arcade &#x2F; go-kart &#x2F; mini-golf center that&#x27;s Rocky & Bullwinkle themed. When I was a kid I thought R&B were on the same level as like Disneyland as every birthday party or event was hosted at one of them. reply syndicatedjelly 10 hours agorootparentprevI was a kid when the series finished, and got my first comic “The Indispensable Calvin & Hobbes” when I was 6. Granted I was young, but the “political” stuff was what made it funny. Young me found the storylines totally puzzling, yet hilarious. Even after I got older and started understanding the “political” comics more, it didn’t really bother me. Calvin and Hobbes explore philosophy more than politics, in my view.The main characters are named after 17th century philosophers John Calvin and Thomas Hobbes, after all reply LastTrain 9 hours agorootparentprevMan conservatives are touchy. reply OfSanguineFire 9 hours agorootparentWhat a bizarre reaction to my post. Watterson’s complaints about modern art, for example, are conservative, and it is people on the other end of the divide who might be turned off by that. Watterson in the mid 1990s was an aging Midwestern white male, and some traits of conservatism are exactly what one would expect from that demographic. reply LastTrain 8 hours agorootparentThe political views in Calvin and Hobbes, where they exist at all, are much more in line with 60&#x27;s counter-culture: anti-consumerism, distrust of authority figures, labor issues. Where there are right-leaning references (e.g. \"Commies\") they are mocking. Think Colonel Flag in MASH.My reaction was not bizarre, I live in a deeply red place where at least once in every social gathering I get to hear some harp about \"the media\" or political correctness, so I know it when I see it. It is amusing because it is so enshrined in \"modern\" conservative culture (well, not so modern, it started in the early 90s...) to complain about this that it creeps into everything. reply drschwabe 10 hours agoparentprevIronically now with AI art tech the fans themselves can now carry on the series as they like (including making animated flicks). Not saying this wouldn&#x27;t violate C&H&#x27;s IP protections nor that the resulting product will have the same essence but a creative+technically inclined fan tinkering in spare time now has the power to create an all new &#x27;Calvin & Hobbes book&#x27; of their dreams. Even if they want to just do it for fun on their own.Of course, if you were to put in enough effort to make a complete book (ie- 100+ page Sunday comic collections) that could stand among the rest in the original series probably best to adjust your art style, theme and content enough away from the original to make what you are doing essentially a spiritual successor - enabling you to comfortably share it with the outside world. reply sdwr 10 hours agoprev> Goblins steal a mother’s child and replace it with a ravenous changeling. When the woman asks a neighbor for advice on how to get her child back, she is told to make the changeling laugh, because “when a changeling laughs, that’s the end of him.”The older I get, the more I tend to see literal meaning instead of metaphor.
