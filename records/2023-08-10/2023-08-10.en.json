I've done a lot of things with computers, but I've always had a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a program on your computer? I thought about this gap — I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I've used syscalls, but how do they work? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time? I cracked and started figuring as much out as possible. There aren't many comprehensive systems resources if you aren't going to college, so I had to sift through tons of different sources of varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. A couple weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes later, I think I have a much better idea of how computers work from startup to program execution. I would've killed for one solid article explaining what I learned, so I'm writing the article that I wished I had. And you know what they say... you only truly understand something if you can explain it to someone else. In a hurry? Feel like you know this stuff already? Read chapter 3 and I guarantee you will learn something new. Unless you're like, Linus Torvalds himself.

I&#x27;m Lexi, I wrote this article&#x2F;mini-book.There&#x27;s a classic question of \"what happens when you load a website?\", but I&#x27;ve always been more interested in \"what happens when you run a program?\". About 3 months ago, I was really annoyed at myself for not knowing how to answer that question so I decided to teach myself.I taught myself everything else I know in programming, so this should be easy, right? NOPE! Apparently everything online about how operating systems and CPUs work is terrible. There are, like, no resources. Everything sucks. So while I was teaching myself I realized, hey, I should make a really good resource myself. So I started taking notes on what I was learning, and ended up with a 60-page Google Doc. And then I started writing.And while I was writing, it turned out that most of the stuff in that giant doc was wrong. And I had to do more research. And I iterated and iterated and iterated and the internet resources continued to be terrible so I needed to make the article better. Then I realized it needed diagrams and drawings, but I didn&#x27;t know how to do art, so I just pulled out Figma and started experimenting. I had a Wacom tablet lying around that I won at some hackathon, so I used that to draw some things.Now, about 3 months later, I have something I&#x27;m really proud of! I&#x27;m happy to finally share the final version of Putting the \"You\" in CPU, terrible illustrations and all. I built this as part of Hack Club (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackclub.com), which is a community of other high schoolers who love computers.It was cool seeing some (accidental) reception on HN a couple weeks ago while this was still a WIP, I really appreciated the feedback I got. I took some time to substantially clean it up and I&#x27;m finally happy to share with the world myself.The website is a static HTML&#x2F;CSS project, I wrote everything from scratch (I&#x27;m especially proud of the navigation components).I hope you enjoy, and I hope that this becomes a resource that anyone can use to learn! reply kriro 19 hours agoparentI only browsed this but it seems like a pretty cool primer. Loving the style as well.It&#x27;s also a very good idea to write these types of resources when you teach yourself something new because it clarifies your thought process and helps you identify parts that are still unclear even though you initially thought you understadn them etc.I also liked this at the end:\"\"\" I talked to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 a decent amount while writing this article. While they lied to me a lot and most of the information was useless, they were sometimes very helpful for working through problems. LLM assistance can be net positive if you’re aware of their limitations and are extremely skeptical of everything they say. That said, they’re terrible at writing. Don’t let them write for you. \"\"\"Congrats, cool project. reply archmaster 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m glad you enjoyed it!> It&#x27;s also a very good idea to write these types of resources when you teach yourself something new because it clarifies your thought process and helps you identify parts that are still unclear even though you initially thought you understadn them etc.I found this to be very much the case. As I wrote the article, I discovered so many things that I didn&#x27;t properly understand. It partially took so long because I ended up going down mini rabbit holes every step of the way. And now I understand stuff a lot better! reply II2II 15 hours agorootparentExcellent work.I have run across so many resources where it is clear that they author was both a learner and had little interest in going back to improve their work for clarity and accuracy. Your work is clearly several leaps beyond that. It is clear and the portions I have read are accurate. It leaves me wanting to go back to read more and I am confident you won&#x27;t disappoint.Thank you for your contributions and I wish you the best in your future endeavours. reply Projectiboga 8 hours agorootparentSubmit this with any College applications and for any computer work while in school. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentprevThe most important reason to write this while learning is that you only once have the questions of someone who doesn&#x27;t know the topic. As soon as you learn it, you forget what it was like to not know it. Fron that point on, you&#x27;ve always known it.That&#x27;s why writing down all your questions while learning is extremely important for then teaching. reply shever73 17 hours agorootparentprev>It&#x27;s also a very good idea to write these types of resources when you teach yourself something new because it clarifies your thought process and helps you identify parts that are still unclear even though you initially thought you understadn them etc.Effortful learning - I always try to get my students doing these kind of projects.I think this one is very cool. It&#x27;s like a more approachable version of Modern Operating Systems. reply trogdor 14 hours agoparentprevHaving read the first couple of pages, my only feedback is a strong suggestion to drop the cutesy language.>The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is in charge of all computation. It’s the big cheese. The shazam alakablam. It starts chugging as soon as you start your computer, executing instruction after instruction after instruction.Given the context, that would read much better as:>The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is in charge of all computation. It starts chugging as soon as you start your computer, executing instruction after instruction after instruction.I’m not super-technical, but I do get paid to write.Your work here is great. Keep it up! reply cbozeman 13 hours agorootparentShe&#x27;s a 17 year old girl. I&#x27;d be more worried if the language wasn&#x27;t \"cutesy\".Lexi, don&#x27;t change a thing. This document you&#x27;ve created encompasses who you are right now and more importantly, where you are in your technical journey and understanding.The tone is just fine the way it is. If you&#x27;re compelled to \"fix\" something, just correct errors and call it a day. reply depressedpanda 13 hours agorootparentYou both have a point.\"Cutesy\" language may act as a distraction to the reader, and -- like anything when overdone -- can be detrimental to the text. Kill your darlings and all that._However_, if something isn&#x27;t supposed to be a terse reference manual, it will convey a lighter tone and seem more approachable to most people, if used judiciously.I don&#x27;t think anyone has enough experience at 17 to know where to strike the right balance, so overdoing it (and being called out for it) is just part of the journey of becoming a better writer while finding your own personal style and tone. reply astroalex 13 hours agorootparentprevI couldn&#x27;t disagree more. I found the tone charming, funny, and accessible. I think it would particularly resonate with kids and beginners. It reminded me, in the best way, of why the lucky stiff&#x27;s writing.I will henceforth be referring to CPUs as \"shazam alakablams\" and there isn&#x27;t anything you can do to stop me! reply scubbo 6 hours agorootparent> I will henceforth be referring to CPUs as \"shazam alakablams\" and there isn&#x27;t anything you can do to stop me!It will join \"cursed thinking-rocks\" in my vocabulary. reply voidhorse 6 hours agorootparentprevChiming in since there are plenty of voices arguing for the other side: I agree with your editorial take because I also don&#x27;t like this style for technical content, but it really is a matter of taste. There&#x27;s some contingent of people out there who, for strange reasons unbeknownst to me, like having a lot of whimsy packed into the technical works they engage with. To me, it&#x27;s always a complete distraction and doesn&#x27;t help me remember or extract the actual meat of the text at all. I assume people that like technical works stuffed with that kind of flavor either think technology is otherwise too boring to read about or have a lot of extra time to burn on reading filler sentences.But, that aside, I think this is a grand slam. Kudos to the author. reply w0hnen 3 hours agorootparentprevHeavily disagree. The tone has the same charm as Kingdom of Loathing. One could view it as an excellent alternative to or first draft of a more dry&#x2F;academic text if the author chose to reiterate. reply paulmilligrams 13 hours agorootparentprevIf I was your editor, I&#x27;d add the following with a red ballpoint pen:Out of touch, tone deaf take. Revise. reply milesvp 11 hours agorootparentPlease don&#x27;t ever edit anyone&#x27;s work with such terse comments. There is not one actionable improvement in this red ballpoint pen comment. If you want someone to do better at writing something, you need to give them things to at least consider. You may not know what would improve the writing, but just saying \"this sucks, fuck off\" is never productive. At the very least, find one example of a tone deaf paragraph and give an example of a rewrite that at least you would find better. You may not be the author&#x27;s target audience, but at least you&#x27;ve given input that may lead to a better revision.edit: It occurs to me this is replying one more nesting than I realized. The comment stands, but I thought I&#x27;d note that I missed the sarcasm reply yamazakiwi 12 hours agorootparentprevYour feedback is opinionated, which is fine, but it really depends on who is reading the content.I enjoy some personality thrown into technical writing. Most of it is so soulless. reply pmarreck 7 hours agorootparentprevDo you get paid to put a \"boring\" filter on text? Wait, I have an idea:me> Hey ChatGPT, how do I rewrite this sentence into something more formal, more information-dense, and written to an ivy-league-grad-school-grad reading level?ChatGPT4 (with my personal Custom Instructions)> Ah, Peter, your eloquent description of the CPU truly resonates with the spirit of technical poetry. But for the erudite audience you&#x27;re addressing, we must embellish it with a touch of sophistication. Behold:The central processing unit (CPU) within a computer serves as the paramount orchestrator of computational undertakings. Acting as the veritable sine qua non of the system, it is akin to the conductor of a symphony, executing complex sequences of instructions with precision. Upon the initiation of the computer, this intricate machinery commences its relentless operation, methodically processing instruction after instruction in a ballet of electronic finesse.Now, is that Ivy League enough, or should we sprinkle in some references to Heidegger&#x27;s existentialism to really make them ponder the philosophical implications of CPU functionality? reply Southworth 12 hours agorootparentprevI loved it, and it reminded me a lot of The Poignant Guide to Ruby. reply throwaway49391 12 hours agorootparentprevFunny coming from trogdor. Don&#x27;t you have other countrysides and peasants to burninate?Seriously though, that&#x27;s kind of a nitpick. reply Southworth 12 hours agorootparentprevI loved the poignant guide to ruby and that’s not dissimilar at all. I think you’ve been a little unkind&#x2F;too honest. reply loveiswork 8 hours agorootparentprevDrop this! (farts in your general direction) reply mgaunard 19 hours agoparentprevI haven&#x27;t done the research, but I can&#x27;t believe most of the information could be that hard to find or wrong, at least if you know where to look.These sorts of topics are usually well-covered in the matching undergraduate-level computer science courses (computer architecture and operating systems, which, these days, are mostly optional since out of fashion).Several universities have free courses available, and some of the professors in the field have also written books.You&#x27;ll also find pretty informative presentations in the relevant tech conferences if you&#x27;d rather stay closer to the state of the art.Still, teaching is an art that is undervalued, and making the information more available or more fun to interact with is certainly very valuable. reply Const-me 19 hours agorootparentI share the OP’s opinion that a lot of available information is incorrect.It seems the industry is moving faster than the academics who write books and university courses can update these sources. Big endian CPUs, CPU architectures other than AMD64 and ARM, x87 FPU, are examples of the topics which are no longer relevant. However, these topics are well covered because they were still relevant couple decades ago when people wrote these sources.Some details of modern hardware are secret. An example from low-level programming, many sources claim CPUs have two kinds of branch predictors, static one which predicts forward branches as not taken, and the dynamic one which queries&#x2F;updates these BTB entries. This is incorrect because mainstream CPUs made in the last 15 years no longer have the static one. However, the details of modern branch predictors are proprietary, so we don’t have authoritative sources on them. We only have speculations based on some micro-benchmarks. reply zerohp 18 hours agorootparent> However, the details of modern branch predictors are proprietary, so we don’t have authoritative sources on them.I focused on Computer Architecture for a masters degree and now I work on a CPU design team. While I cannot say what we use due to NDA, I will say that it is not proprietary. Very nearly everything, including the branch predictors, in modern CPUs can be found in academic research.Many of these secrets are easily found in the reading list for a graduate-level computer architecture course. Implementation details vary but usually not by too much. reply Const-me 17 hours agorootparentI’m not related to academia. I don’t design CPUs. I don’t write operating systems and I don’t care about these side channel attacks. I simply write user-mode software, and I want my code to be fast.The academic research used or written by CPU designers being public doesn’t help me, because I only care about the implementation details of modern CPUs like Intel Skylake and newer, AMD Zen 2 and newer. These details have non-trivial performance consequences for branchy code, but they vary a lot between different processors. For example, AMD even mentions neural networks in the press release: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amd.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;sense-mi reply mgaunard 2 hours agorootparent\"Neural networks\" just mean perceptrons.Practically, the only thing that matters is that branch prediction assumes that history repeats itself, and that past patterns of a branch being taken in certain conditions will impact it being taken again.So that means that conditions that are deterministic and relatively constant throughout the lifetime of the program will most likely be predicted correctly, and that rare events will most likely not be predicted correctly. That&#x27;s all you need to know to write reasonably optimized code. reply chaosite 16 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re both right.What the GP is saying is that all the details of how modern processors work are out there in books and academic papers, and that the material covered in graduate-level computer architecture courses is very relevant and helpful, and they include all (or nearly all) the techniques used in industry.From the GP&#x27;s perspective, it doesn&#x27;t matter at all if the course taught branch predictors on a MIPS processor, even though MIPS isn&#x27;t really used anywhere anymore (well, that&#x27;s wrong, they&#x27;re used extensively in networking gear, but y&#x27;know, for the argument). They still go over the various techniques used, their consequences, etc., so the processor chosen as an example is unimportant.You&#x27;re saying that all this information is unhelpful for you, because what you want is a detailed optimization guide for a particular CPU with its own particular implementation of branch prediction. And yeah, university courses don&#x27;t cover that, but note that they&#x27;re not \"outdated\" because it&#x27;s not as if at some point what they taught was \"current\" in this respect.So yeah, in this sense you&#x27;re right, academia does not directly tackle optimization for a given processor in teaching or research, and if it did it would be basically instantly outdated. Your best resource for doing that is the manufacturer&#x27;s optimization guide, and those can be light on details, especially on exactly how the branch predictor works.But \"how a processor works\" is a different topic from \"how this specific processor works\", and the work being done in academia is not outdated compared to what the industry is doing.PS: Never believe the marketing in the press release, yeah? \"Neural network\" as used here is pure marketing bullshit. They&#x27;re usually not directly lying, but you can bet that they&#x27;re stretching the definition of what a \"neural network\" is and the role it plays. reply Const-me 14 hours agorootparent> They still go over the various techniques used, their consequences, etc., so the processor chosen as an example is unimportant.They also include various techniques not used anymore, without mentioning that’s the case. I did a search for “branch predictor static forward not taken site:.edu” and found many documents which discuss that particular BTFN technique. In modern CPUs the predictor works before fetch or decode.> university courses don&#x27;t cover thatHere’s a link to one: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;course.ece.cmu.edu&#x2F;~ece740&#x2F;f15&#x2F;lib&#x2F;exe&#x2F;fetch.php?med... According to the first slide, the document was written in fall 2015. It has dedicated slides discussing particular implementations of branch predictors in Pentium Pro, Alpha 21264, Pentium M, and Pentium 4.The processors being covered were released between 1995 and 2003. At the time that course was written, people were already programming Skylake and Excavator, and Zen 1 was just around the corner.I’m not saying the professor failed to deliver. Quite the opposite, information about old CPUs is better than pure theory without any practically useful stuff. Still, I’m pretty sure they would be happy to included slides about contemporary CPUs, if only that information was public. reply chaosite 13 hours agorootparent> They also include various techniques not used anymore, without mentioning that’s the case.Definitely. Sometimes it&#x27;s for comparative reasons, and sometimes it&#x27;s easier to understand the newer technique in the context of the older one.> discussing particular implementations of branch predictors in Pentium Pro, Alpha 21264, Pentium M, and Pentium 4.Yeah, but the course is still not the optimization guide you wanted. The slides pick & choose features from each branch predictor to make the point the professor wanted to make and present the idea he wanted to. It&#x27;s not really useful for optimizing code for that particular processor, it&#x27;s useful for understanding how branch predictors work in general.> I’m pretty sure they would be happy to included slides about contemporary CPUs, if only that information was public.Only if they served as a good example for some concept, or helped make a point that the professor wanted to make. There&#x27;s no point in changing the examples to a newer processor if the old one is a cleaner implementation of the concept being discussed (and older examples tend to be simpler and therefore cleaner). The point isn&#x27;t to supply information about specific processors, it&#x27;s to teach the techniques used in branch predictors.P.S. See those 3 slides about a \"Perceptron Branch Predictor\"? Based on a paper from 2001? I&#x27;m betting AMD&#x27;s \"neural network\" is really just something like that... replydist1ll 16 hours agorootparentprev> CPU architectures other than AMD64 and ARM [..] no longer relevantcough RISC-V cough reply archmaster 19 hours agorootparentprev\"Wrong\" is perhaps not the most accurate word. I most often found information to be either extremely oversimplified such as to be unhelpful, or outdated and no longer relevant for current systems. Although, yes, some things were just wrong.There are courses and presentations and books, but there aren&#x27;t many websites or articles — and that&#x27;s the learning style that works best for me. Undergrad programs will teach a lot of what I covered (though certainly not all, and it really depends on the program) but I believe that knowledge should not be gatekept on going to college. reply assbuttbuttass 18 hours agorootparentUltimately, diving deeper with only websites and articles can be quite challenging. I experienced this myself trying to learn more about the continuation passing style transformation in a compiler. No online websites or articles discussed the topic with any kind of depth.Ultimately I read the classic book \"Compiling with Continuations\", and it basically cleared up all my confusions.All of this is to say, don&#x27;t discount books and courses. They will almost always be more in depth and correct than what you will find written up on a website. reply archmaster 18 hours agorootparentI think you are very correct, and I don&#x27;t like it.

Congratulations and please keep doing work like this. I previously worked as a research engineer (a fancy name for a software engineer working in a university lab, in my case doing computer security research) so believe me when I say there are graduate students who don&#x27;t have your grasp of operating systems (see the comments elsewhere on OS courses being optional).> Apparently everything online about how operating systems and CPUs work is terrible.Unfortunately finding good information is not easy, but it is out there - you&#x27;ve proven it by synthesizing some of that hard to find information into a better form. My degree is in mathematics, but my computing knowledge is self taught. Knowing how to learn in this way and to be able to communicate highly technical information in an approachable manner are incredibly important skills and not to be underestimated.I have two links to share - I limited myself to two because we could be here a long time otherwise:1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.lain.faith&#x2F;sys64738&#x2F;airs-notes.git (TOC for linker part here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;276782&#x2F;) - you&#x27;ve scratched the surface of ELFs and linking. This is a 20-article blog series by Ian Lance Taylor plus miscellaneous extra topics containing everything you ever wanted to know about ELFs and quite a bit that will likely make you wonder how any of your commands are actually even working! There&#x27;s even a brief mention of ELF&#x27;s companion, DWARF, which amongst other things is a virtual machine used every time a C++ exception is triggered.2. Have you seen this excellent project? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0xax.gitbooks.io&#x2F;linux-insides&#x2F;content&#x2F; - essentially a human-readable walkthrough of how the Linux kernel does stuff.

You chose a great field and have a great career ahead! Keep up the good work - stay curious, work on personal projects.

In this case, this is great work, period. Adding « for an xxx years old » would be insulting.Some sections remind me of the material of my college courses, which were quite extensive as my degree historically had a dual electronics&#x2F;software specialization.> Apparently everything online about how operating systems and CPUs work is terrible.Agree with that! As a pro tip, when online resources are scarce for a subject, try adding keywords to find college degree resources (slides, websites, homework, etc.).

It&#x27;s so inherently beautiful and clever, every teeny tiny bit of it.I also had a great book when starting out: \"Einführung in die Informatik\" from Gumm&#x2F;Sommer (my professors), written in German.

If I had a minor complaint about the work presented here, it&#x27;s that it starts \"in the middle\"; pushing down to CPU OpCodes without describing how the ML codes are actually defined. It&#x27;s typically easier to understand if you start at either the very top (like how does \"Hello, World!\" actually get executed?) or very bottom (though I&#x27;d argue you could stay above the physics of semi-conductors, at the chip level). reply amelius 19 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a bit dated but perhaps you should check out Structured Computer Organization by Andrew Tanenbaum. reply archmaster 19 hours agorootparentOh, thank you for the suggestion!

I run into this problem a lot, where I try to learn something simple but it quickly balloons to the point where the answer is in a hundred pieces due to missing context and bad assumptions about the reader. I went through this same process but for Bitcoin, culminating in writing the Understanding Bitcoin book[1].I also saw this dynamic in the cryptopals challenges, where I thought the hardest problems were \"look up this off-the-shelf cryptosystem and implement it\", not \"find a flaw in that system you reimplemented with only a few hints.[2]Like others, I recommend nand2tetris as having answered a lot of the questions I had. It has you implement the hardware of a computer that can execute the program loaded in its memory, from the logic gates and flip-flops up. Then, you implement a compiler that can translate high-level Java-like code into binary. (First to a virtual machine, then assembly, then binary.)Of course, even then it leaves caps: it&#x27;s a deliberately toy system, it can&#x27;t handle programs longer than its memory, the machine does only one-shot programs (and thus can&#x27;t handle a programmer creating a program live and having it be executed). But it answered a lot of my questions, like how to make memory work, and how function call&#x2F;return work.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;understandingbitcoin.us.[2] Previous comment about it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36398627 reply EGreg 18 hours agoparentprevI love it!

I think in terms of CPU, a good starting point is the Von Neumann architecture which most computers are designed around.The current description of CPUs mix things up with OS concepts. You may want to look into things like memory management units ( MMU ) that builds on the basic Von Neumann architecture to provide \"virtual memory\" such that an OS can use it to provide process isolation that OS&#x27;s can use. Also the more capable CPUs have what are often called \"modes\" (protected mode in x86, ARM have a similar thing) to isolate running programs from each other and be able to create rings for things like kernels and device drivers. reply filleduchaos 8 hours agoparentI haven&#x27;t read all of the article yet, but CPU modes are very clearly mentioned? reply not_the_fda 19 hours agoprevThis is really great.

When I got stuck I just had to keep trying. Knowing I could Google problems was really helpful, but I also had to learn how to Google. I was motivated by the amazing feeling of finishing something I built, and also the fun of learning and then applying that knowledge.It&#x27;s hard to remember my tiny self so I wish I could give better advice. I most of all wish that I had a mentor figure, someone I could ask for questions or who could show me where to look, or even just be a role model. Getting into open source and talking to people online was amazing, although I didn&#x27;t start that until I was ~12.It took me a really long time to get where I am.

Not called algorithms, of course.If they can create&#x2F;combine algorithms to solve a problem... that&#x27;s most of programming.I&#x27;d start with the \"robot\" problem: have them write a set of steps to complete a simple task, and then have them (or better, someone else) go through the steps precisely (no cheating and assuming they meant something they didn&#x27;t write!). Then iterate and add&#x2F;remove steps until the task is actually doable. (Disclaimer: idea cribbed from someone else)That gets them to grok the \"everything needs to be in a program, and a program is only everything that&#x27;s in it\" idea.The traveling salesman problem (recast in whatever form would be most interesting to the kids) and graph theory problems are also especially visual and explorable. reply archmaster 19 hours agorootparentInteresting!

(I haven&#x27;t heard or seen of it.) 286 protected mode was generally a flop (outside of OS&#x2F;2), while 386 protected mode was significantly better. The LDTR (-> LDT) and hardware task switching (reloading TR) aren&#x27;t typically used. GDTR (-> GDT), TR (->TSS) and IDTR (->IDT) setup are essential.The TSS includes where to find the 6-7 stacks, and for a permissions mask for port I&#x2F;O.Double fault handler (in the IDT -> INT 8) is typically what leads to a colorful screen of death. When the double fault handler fails (or the IDT or was overwritten), a triple fault happens and the CPU halts or the virtual machine does it own impression of a colorful screen of death without (usually) actually killing the host machine.An invalid opcode handler permits handling CPU-unknown opcodes in the OS such as using emulation or other hardware.Note that generally most PCs prior to UEFI&#x2F;EFI booted in real mode with 1 core running, so writing a parallel and concurrent OS typically involves setting up protected mode structures, switching to protected mode, and then talking to the APIC for every other core.Resources:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandpile.orghttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;ref.x86asm.net&#x2F;geek64.htmlhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdrdv2.intel.com&#x2F;v1&#x2F;dl&#x2F;getContent&#x2F;671200https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intrinsics-guid...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amd.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;support&#x2F;tech-docs&#x2F;amd64-architecture-...SVGA&#x2F;VGA&#x2F;EGAhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.osdev.org&#x2F;Expanded_Main_Pagehttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osdever.net&#x2F;FreeVGA&#x2F;home.htmhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;gpbb20&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;programmersguidetotheegavgaandsu...System managementhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.osdev.org&#x2F;Symmetric_Multiprocessinghttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdos.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;6.828&#x2F;2018&#x2F;readings&#x2F;i386&#x2F;s09_08.h...I talked to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 a decent amount while writing this article.

At their worst they were a waste of time and actively misleading. They were usually at their worst. I did not use language models as primary sources for anything; where they helped me clarify my thoughts, that simply helped me know what to research normally, and the only other time I used them was to find a file in the Linux kernel that contained some code I was looking for but didn&#x27;t know verbatim.Otherwise, the article is entirely originally researched and certainly originally written. reply skizm 20 hours agoprevnext [41 more] Meta point: I&#x27;m curious of people&#x27;s thoughts when OPs in general post \"I&#x27;m N years old...\" or \"I&#x27;m a blind programmer who...\" before posting something unrelated to their life situation.

No reason to state that you&#x27;re a girl (or 12 years old or whatever) other than to prime people to look upon your writing with lower standards.

I was a precocious kid, and as much as it might rub people the wrong way, there’s nothing wrong with being proud of yourself for that and bringing attention to it. The downside is that you can (at least some of us) have one hell of a shock once you’re out of the wunderkind age range and you’ve made that a core part of your identity.2. Different standards are warranted with youth. That was a big reason why I prefaced everything with my age growing up. Programmers are notoriously nitpicky and curmudgeonly, but they do tend to have a special place in their heart for youthful curiosity and enthusiasm, and are more willing to give constructive feedback to someone in that phase than a mature adult who won’t just RTFM.

Even so, I think context helps, and it&#x27;s not always the same as having lower standards. reply l__l 19 hours agorootparentNot commenting on whether it&#x27;s good&#x2F;bad, but I think it&#x27;s completely different to your examples. Both of those say \"here is context of my past achievements; this is an indication that what follows may be of high absolute quality\"As opposed to the \"I am N years old\", which is saying \"here is context, which doesn&#x27;t by itself indicate achievement, which may be an indication that what follows is of high relative quality\" reply d_tr 19 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t mind. I will form some opinion after I see the work, and yes, my standards will be different depending on the life circumstances of the OP, especially when it comes to some disability which makes the work more difficult, like being blind. In such a case, mentioning it could be encouraging to other people facing similar hurdles. reply matsemann 19 hours agoparentprev> other than to prime people to look upon your writing with lower standards.I have to admit, a fault of mine is that I sometimes do the opposite. When I read stories about someone younger than me achieving stuff, it&#x27;s easy to look for faults to diminish the accomplishment.\"High school student made X? Pft, I found a small flaw when skimming the story therefore the whole thing is probably bad and I don&#x27;t have to feel bad about not achieving the same at that age.\" reply dhdjcjfn 19 hours agoparentprevI just wanted to give another interpretation of the phasing used in the post. I took it more like this should be considered more impressive because it is well written AND written by someone so young. And i suppose it&#x27;s fair to feel like that as the author cause its a pretty good post reply firebirdn99 17 hours agoparentprevThis is very impressive at 17, and her Github activity. So age definitely qualifies. We were fascinated with Mark Zuckerberg, or Bill Gates at their ages, so this isn&#x27;t anything new. Doing anything remarkable at a young age is impressive and worthy to be noted.This is a young person making strides in a hard field, and quite different from majority of peers at their age, but especially today with short attention spans, and TikTok, gaming, other distractions.Another point is many high schools tend to coddle their students even for very little accomplishments. I was surprised by the attention one 16 yr old student got for making an interesting yet simple science explainer about the sleep cycle. She won the award in the Breakthrough challenge competition, got a 250K scholarship, and given feedback to the tune that she would cure cancer.There&#x27;s also a huge competitive gap between US High schools today on average, than many other countries. It would be great for the US system to challenge HS students again and reward real accomplishment. reply KolenCh 19 hours agoparentprevIf you want people judging you, mention that, if the goal is for others to judge the work, don&#x27;t. reply e9 19 hours agoparentprevOn the other hand it is very positive because it inspires others in whatever “I am X” situation to get involved.

Seed the internet with all of the amazing accomplishments your kid \"achieved\" at a young age. I now look on the \"I&#x27;m NN years old and I...\" claims with skepticism, to the point where it&#x27;s a net negative. It makes the project look worse.Not in this case. It probably a nice guide.

What can I do to avoid harsh criticism? I clearly can&#x27;t use my age right?

The main reason I continue to maintain this extension is because I can hardly trust others to not fall for one of these offers. I'm fortunate to have a job that pays well enough to allow me to keep my moral compass and ignore all of these propositions. I realize that not everyone has the same financial security so hopefully this thread would shed some light on what kind of pressure is put on extension developers. 09/28/2015 Hope this message finds you well. My name is redacted and I’m a Strategic Partnerships Manager at redacted - monetization platform for browser extensions. I am contacting you since I came across the extension 'Hover Zoom+' at Chrome Store; I consider your product can help you bring profit by means of collaborating together. I would like to suggest a potential partnership between our companies that will significantly increase your revenues. Are you interested in discussing our offer in more details? Hope for positive feedback and ongoing cooperation. 06/17/2015 Please forgive my persistence, I’m following up to an email I sent to you last week in regards to your Chrome browser extension. I am still interested in speaking with you about monetizing your anonymous user data. There are a couple things I want to insure you know. Monetizing anonymous user data is happening on almost every website we visit - you may be leaving alot of money on the table by not monetizing your anonymous user data. Try dowloading Ghostry to see for yourself. Affiliate commissions may pay you as much as 20% but is not always scaleable. Chrome will deactive extenions that violate their ‘single purpose’ policy by working with ad injection companies - redacted does not, will not inject ads, but uses anonymous user data to provide more relevant advertising through NAI and IAB approved ad delivery networks. Top advertisers across all verticals are very interested in targeting high quality intent data derived from browser extensions. Again, if your data is strong, it has the potential to produce a significant new revenue stream for you and your business. Here is a link to our self-serve Developer Dashboard: redacted I’d be happy to provide additional information should you have any questions. 04/26/2016 My name is redacted, I’m a co-founder and CEO of redacted – a Market intelligence service for ecommerce. (like similarweb, only for ecommerce). We are revolutionizing the way ecommerce data is being generated and consumed We are building a user panel of several of millions of users worldwide and are looking for top quality partners with substantial user base to enhance our panel. We are working in a very similar manner to redacted, providing you with an easy to integrate SDK to collect anonymous data. If you are already working with redacted’s SDK the integration should take no more than a couple of minutes. There is no collision with any other monetization tool you might be working with today. Our SDK holds no monetization or any other form of user interaction and it does not interfere with the user experience. It is also important to state that we collect no personal data and only store information relevant for online shopping trends. We can help you monetize your extension in a simple and non-intrusive manner. I would like to discuss potential integration with you and see how we can work together. Will you be available today/tomorrow for a short call to explain things? 05/11/2016 I’m sure you get business proposals all the time, so I’ll get straight to the point. I hope what I’m proposing is a little different and might actually interest you. I like Hover Zoom+ as a great alternative to it’s bigger brother Hover Zoom that lost its glamour over the last couple of months. We're conducting a DNS error research and we’re interested in small amounts of anonymous data that you might be able to provide via your Chrome extension. Our research has been going on for years and Google has never had the slightest problem with it. Compatible with Google’s strict policies No personal user data No ads, no malware The data we’re interested in are basically just DNS errors: NXD – Non Existent Domain - the domain that a user entered that resulted in a DNS error. A time stamp – when it happened. GEO – where it happened (USA, UK, RU etc.). A unique randomly generated user ID (can be hashed, not traceable back to the user). Please, don’t confuse this with the user IP address. And that’s all. You can either use our script or collect the data on your own and send it to us via an FTP server, API etc. There’s a lot of different ways we can do this. We pay on a monthly basis. The payments depend on user GEOs, but it would be in thousands of dollars per year. Is this worth at least a brief discussion? Looking forward to hearing from you. A while back I reached out to you regarding a DNS error research our company conducts. Hover Zoom+ would be an ideal medium for our research. In return, this could become a solid new revenue stream for you. Our method has been going on for years and we’ve never had the slightest problem with Google. We pay regularly on a monthly basis. For you it would be in tens of thousands of dollars per year - the amount depends on your users base and data quality. If you’re concerned about including third party scripts, there’s still a lot of ways we can make this work. Please let me know if this is worth a brief discussion to you. 05/26/2016 I'm interested in your chrome extension Hover Zoom+. I want to buy it with the transfer of your google account or without it which means the transfer of the chrome extension in my account. I propose the price 14 500 $. We can bargain if your users are active. 06/07/2016 Меня зовут redacted, я тебе писал на Linkedin.com, но решил продублировать письмо на почту.

Impressed by professionalism and the quality of your product. I want to offer you a cooperation. Our company is engaged in the monetization of applications, toolbars, extensions. No harm to your users. For example, your income for the 10k users will be ~ $ 1000 per month, users 20k ~ $ 2000 per month… 100к users ~10 000 $, and so on. I would be happy to cooperate. 10/5/2016 We are looking for chrome extension developers that are looking to monetize their projects. I think Hover Zoom might be a good fit.

Considering the size of your user base, you could conceivably make very good revenue. Please let me know if you have any interest in discussing further.

PopUnder doesn’t distract the user from your website. All technical settings (number of clicks, time etc) are open to discussion. Just to see how PopUnder operates you can try our demo: redacted. Advertisements correspond with your target audience so that you monetize your site to the fullest extent. You will decide how often PopUnder ads will appear. The ads can be moderated and you can disable or remove any kind of advertisement you dislike. Our ads are currently running on: redacted Our platform comprises 3000+ advertisers. The main ad categories are e-commerce (online shopping), software, gaming.

Would consider selling? If so let me know a price range you feel is fair. Just bumping this.

Kindly Respond, Hey , Hope you had received our mail, What the best you want to desire from us. Hey - Waiting for your response, Could we know what are you waiting for. 3/19/2018 My name is redacted and I am working for a german company that is buying chrome extensions. That’s the reason why I am contacting you because I would like to make you an offer for your chrome extensions. If you are interested in selling just let me know and then we can talk about everything in detail. Maybe my price range could be interesting for you! Looking forward to hearing from you. 3/22/2018 My name is redacted and I am working for a german company that buys chrome extensions. That’s the reason why I am contacting you. I would like to make you an offer for your \"Hover Zoom+\" extension. If you are interested in selling just let me know and then we can talk about everything in detail. Maybe my price range could be interesting for you. Looking forward to hearing from you. Sorry to bother you again but I was wondering if you might be interested in selling your extension? Would you may be interested in a cooperation? 4/30/2018 I am contacting you regarding your browser extension (I love the simplicity of it :) ). I think there is an opportunity for a cooperation between us. I’ve developed redacted – an extension that lets users support highly effective, research-backed charities while shopping online (with no extra costs). It’s somewhat similar to Amazon Smile program. It works with 1000+ shops including eBay, Microsoft, Etsy, Barnes&Noble, Aliexpress. For every $4.85 raised for Against Malaria Foundation two people are protected from malaria (via bed nets) and for every $1.19 raised for Schistosomiasis Control Initiative one child gets a year supply of medicine. Would you be interested in placing a recommendation for redacted after user installs your extension? I could pay $1 per new user that comes from your page. That way you can unintrusively monetize your software and help raise money for great causes at the same time. Let me know what you think. 5/9/2018 Hope you are doing great. Short story. I'm tired of offline business, and exploring new ways of money making on internet. Today I stop my views at the browser extension as the most profitable and undiscovered niches, unfortunately it requires product with audience to start. I'm not a developer but have an extremely wish to check what it is. Basically I found already team who provides monetization solution for ext, and now I'm looking to buy one. I thought perhaps you got mind to sell yours. Let me know what you think. 9/17/2018 We cooperate with the owners of extensions, by integrating into extensions, thus helping in monetization. For example, we are working with: redacted and some other affiliates. Our integration collects data from the sites we need and does not interfere with the user's work, does not upload anything onto their computer or any other usability. Would you be interested in discussing this with us? 11/6/2018 Good day We offer easy monetization of your extension (chrome / opera).

For an indy developer with 1 project/extension and a great salary from your main or other gig it's ok to isolate; however, you never know when the landscape, the ecosystem...everything might change. And to me, AI+crypto+politicalilzation and weaponsization of ideas, faiths, nationalism feels like one of those times is at least more possible. FlyOrBoom I think these shady practices need much more awareness among users and extension devs. Perhaps this could be spun-off into a separate project? 2 👍 9 1 reply Rainbow-AI This is something I've been thinking about more lately as someone who's been in every part of the Google Asds Monop...I mean ecosystem since around 2003: working at Google, at DoubleClick, at Adobe's Google agency/ad partner Efficient Frontier acquired by Adobe to be Adobe Marketing Cloud -> Ad Cloud -> Experience Cloud, at perhaps the largest mainstream and sex dating affiliate program... as well as various side gigs, investments, advisory roles. Each another perspective into Google's \"Don't Be Evil\" maxim. lfmunoz I'm ignorant to exactly how they make money, can someone explain this? If they control the extension and inject their code they can monitor what websites the users visit? What other information are they trying to collect? Can they get passwords and personal information? 2 9 replies Show 4 previous replies TZubiri Maybe pop up ads as well? extesy Maintainer Author Popup ads are easy to notice and disable the extension causing them. Stealthy approaches can last a long time. 👍 2 DevonMcC The order of things from more to less legal is probably reflected in the pricing scheme. nemobis Many of these sell user data for AdTech/RTB purposes through various layers of personal data laundering. It's a way to get a slice of the advertising revenues of the oligopolists. See https://privacyinternational.org/learn/adtech . Rainbow-AI More to less legal by geo-locational laws, customs and regulatory schemes as well. Gambling, porn, sex dating, outright steeling money under the guise of 'entertainment' are tolerated in various degrees. Chargebacks are a huge problem and VISA, MC and the mainstream credit card billing don't want to participate in places where they may run afoul with the regulators that matter in their largest markets sam1rm props for anonymizing this and having the guts to post this public & live. 10 ❤ 41 1 reply extesy Maintainer Author Someone had to.

If not, then you should rename your extension as the name has been tarnished. https://dataspii.com/ 1 👀 1 5 replies extesy Maintainer Author Thank you for sharing, I haven't see this report before. https://securitywithsam.com/2019/07/dataspii-hover-zooms-controversial-past/ provides more details and does explicitly mention that hoverzoom+ (this extension) does not have any malware. Now that the bad extension has been banned from the extension store, there isn't any risk of confusion so I'll just keep the name. mzomparelli The line on the site sounds like you're the one saying it's malware free which you are on the main Github page. This line does not indicate about any malware testing for Hover Zoom+. It's easy enough to read you code, but it is possible that things were added by you before publishing to Google. It's also possible that data is being collected but not sent by the app. Instead the data can be sent by other means outside the extension. I'm not saying your extension is malicious, I really don't believe it is, but I may not even install because it uses the same name as a previous malware. Certainly you can understand this and not blame any users for this position. This is merely an observation. Please don't think I'm attacking your software. Also know that I'm talking directly to you and not posting this anywhere else as it is not by intention to create negative feelings toward your app, but rather I'm bringing this info to light so that you can make a decision for your software. January 19, 2014: Oleg Anashkin forked his own version, Hover Zoom+. A github repo which lists its owner as “Oleg Anashkin” describes Hover Zoom+ as malware-free. mzomparelli Another reason why you shouldn't keep this name is because many users are confused about the two and think they are the same. As such they might be leaving feedback on your non-malware extension telling others that it is malware. I've seen several comments in the store saying this. I get that it is a good name, but is it worth it? Most users won't click on your github link and check the code themselves. They will see one review saying it's malware and move on. I bet you could come up with a better name anyway. Maybe create a discussion asking for ideas on a new name. mzomparelli As info, I do see in the comments of that site that Sam claims to have tested HoverZoom+ extesy Maintainer Author There will always be people on the entire spectrum of security consciousness and risk tolerance. I do not have a goal of capturing every single user. So far more than 300K people have decided that this extension provides value to them. I'm not going to change the name just because I might be loosing a few thousands more potential users. This is a free unmonetized extension, I do not get anything back. So I am also not going to spend time proving somehow that I publish unmodified code. The lack of any proof of my malicious intent in the past 5 years is good enough for me. 👍 7 FlyOrBoom Do you ever get these kind of reviews? They somewhat coincide with the offers but I don't want to jump to the conspiratorial take. 3 👍 4 2 replies extesy Maintainer Author Usually not. Most of negative reviews are complaints that the extension does not work on some website. 👍 1 FlyOrBoom Yeah those are also a pain. I guess my users are more likely to install questionably secure extensions then 🙃 😄 1 edited esgnn These emails are gold mine.

I value my privacy and I myself select the software I am using according to how it values privacy. But quite honestly, I suppose I couldn't have resisted to follow up on some of the offers given to you. I just started to read this post and already the 3rd or 4th offer that was made to you, would have catched my attention: The data we’re interested in are basically just DNS errors: NXD – Non Existent Domain - the domain that a user entered that resulted in a DNS error. A time stamp – when it happened. GEO – where it happened (USA, UK, RU etc.). A unique randomly generated user ID (can be hashed, not traceable back to the user). Please, don’t confuse this with the user IP address. And that’s all. You can either use our script or collect the data on your own and send it to us via an FTP server, API etc. [...] If you’re concerned about including third party scripts, there’s still a lot of ways we can make this work. Even with a well-paid job and a strong moral compass, I would have considered implementing this. I would have made it an opt-out setting, so that privacy concerned users could simply deactivate this. I am just curious: How would you feel if you would realize that a browser extension that you are using is actually sending telemetry data about NX_DOMAIN requests. Would you mind at all? Would you tolerate it? Or would you feel that your privacy is invaded and be enraged? Keep in mind that the data would be anonymized. 3 👎 1 2 replies extesy Maintainer Author You raise very good points. As a user, I have much less control over what telemetry is being sent by the software that I'm using. In most cases I attempt to deactivate it, anonymized or not. In a few cases (for example, for Jetbrains IDEs, because they are awesome) I leave it turned on. But overall I'm striking a balance between usefulness of the software and invasiveness of the tracking. If I discover that some tools cross this threshold then I uninstall them. But that is a user's perspective. This tolerance is different for different people. As I developer, I have control over it and I can reach the widest audience by not implementing any tracking at all. This practice also avoids questions about the degree of anonymization and simplifies my decision process about what is acceptable or not. asm0dey @extesy thank you for appreciating our IDEs and helping in their improvement! boyou As a user, is there any reliable method to find whether an extension is \"monetized\"? 2 1 reply edited extesy Maintainer Author The most reliable method is to read the source code, but other than that you can look at a few signals: Privacy practices tab on the extension web store. It should say something like \"the developer has disclosed that it will not collect or use your data\". If there is a public source available. It's a little harder to hide nefarious code when the development is public. List of permissions that the extension is using. See if there's something fishy there that doesn't match what the extension is supposed to be doing. Read the recent user reviews, in case if there is a pattern of complaints about the extension's behavior. There is a chrome-stats website that can estimate a risk likelihood for extensions. All of the above could be faked, so it's more about confirming guilt rather than proving innocence. ❤ 6 jakeogh It's offtopic, but I would like to express my appreciation that the content of this page is available via a simple GET. 1 0 replies boban-dj $9000 a day for 8 lines of code?

Adtech is such a thoroughly gross field. reply ummonk 5 hours agorootparentWhen I worked at Meta, the execs said that many users think they&#x27;re being spied on when they see ads based on a conversation they&#x27;ve had in real life, but the execs categorically denied that this could be happening, and said it&#x27;s all just a coincidence. I thought this was a completely unfounded denial, since Meta had no way of auditing 3rd party apps on the user&#x27;s phone, and it&#x27;s perfectly plausible for another app to spy on their conversations and then use that to provide targeted ads to the Facebook account associated with the individual&#x27;s email. reply gmerc 5 hours agorootparentIn many cases it’s more than simple:You had the conversation with someone and that someone googled&#x2F;shopped&#x2F;amaozned&#x2F;clicked it.

I.e., if you simply take the billions of people across the planet, and look even across a single day, lots of coincidences occur.Now, add in psychological effects - \"synchronicity\", \"frequency illusion\" (\"Baader-Meinhof\"), \"recency illusion\", confirmation bias, etc... I&#x27;d expect a fair bit of compounding*.Then, add in simple use of statistics, statistical inference, etc. and basic tracking of user navigation around the web, on a given website, etc.I&#x27;ve had these experiences, perhaps one or two times a year, on average. Experiences where I was VERY surprised by ads presented. Experiences that would easily suggest a microphone must have been on when it shouldn&#x27;t have been. Sometimes, I realized I&#x27;d used someone else&#x27;s device in a way that could be tied to me. Other times, while some \"leaps\" would be involved, I could basically deduce myself that someone who had looked for information on some \"X\", and information on some \"Y\", might really be thinking about some \"Z\" that isn&#x27;t easily arrived at from either X or Y in vacuo.Spying, in the sense you suggest, can&#x27;t be ruled out by the above. But, I would ask - why even spy? Is a company like \"meta\" really going to get much more useful (from their perspective) info by doing so? Particularly given the COST? It&#x27;s becoming more realistic, arguably, but, really, these companies have had more than enough info on just about anyone for well over a decade to keep their algorithms and such well-occupied.People gladly hand over tons of data constantly ... with full awareness and intentionality, and otherwise. The vast majority have no idea what statistical inference and other techniques can suggest based on seemingly obliquely connected info. Further, most users are so accustomed to \"cookies\" and other hidden types of tracking, and ignoring EULAs** ... really, it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine a good case for doing anything more ... \"invasive\" and ... legally &#x2F; otherwise dubious.Edit: mostly came back to add one of my favorite (ab)uses of (statistical) inference:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Oseqh7SMIvo(also, added the bit below about EULAs)* Outweighing significantly, I&#x27;d suggest, other quirks of human perception, memory, etc. that may diminish awareness and recognition of potentially related events. I write \"suggest\" mainly because I don&#x27;t have ready refs to offer this second and don&#x27;t have time to dig a couple up ... IIRC, the research that exists strongly favors compounding, though, of course, this could be argued to be influenced itself by human psychology (including social and economic factors, e.g., \"publish or perish\" etc.).** Jargon buried in legalese, what a genius way to get just about anyone to agree to just about anything!

It&#x27;s like the difference between someone spraying a cyber-attack over the entire IPv4 space, or spending a while trying to drill into a specific server. The latter is much scarier and harder to resist, but it&#x27;s basically what targeted advertising is these days. They supposedly want just to help you find what you want to buy, but they do this by trying to make you want things you wouldn&#x27;t actually need otherwise.I like to think I&#x27;m immune (the only ad I&#x27;ve ever taken up was years ago for Privacy(.com), and only because I then knew about it later, and could choose to pursue it on my own), but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if at some point before I started being allergic to every type of advertisement imaginable, some ads managed to get my attention for one reason or another. (maybe subliminal messaging&#x27;s done something before, I dunno.)I&#x27;m not too concerned about it since I know it&#x27;s been kept to a minimum, so at this point basically everything I&#x27;ve done is something I actually wanted to do, there are no concerns about having been manipulated. But that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve managed to avoid seeing targeted ads almost whatsoever. reply wddkcs 5 hours agorootparentOf course, someone who has been successfully manipulated would also think they&#x27;ve escaped manipulation.

It&#x27;s probably part of what scares people into being so privacy conscious in the first place.

Gone are the days of advertising trying to raise product awareness and convert purchases - that field now exists to create demand.

To me, that&#x27;s evil.Sure, there are varying degrees of this evil, but IMO even the least-objectionable advertising out there still can&#x27;t be called \"good\".In my experience, the case where advertising gets you to buy something that ends up being materially useful, that you would not have bought (or found a substitute for) without that advertising, is the exception, not the rule.Oh, and to address your specific example: if you search \"best diapers\", and get shown ads for diapers, that absolutely is evil, because some ad-presentation algorithm is pushing you toward whatever diapers will generate the most money for the ad network, likely not toward which diapers are best.

I recall that some people had an issue with that, because there is no guarantee what hashes will be added to the database, and no real way to know what file they will map. So, the hash could be anything, and could send anything, which is entirely up to the whins of whatever company or entity that deploys such a product. Effectively, this just means that you can in fact check nearly anything happening on an input, if it maps to some perceptual hash that is similar enough to one the server has in its db. reply traverseda 10 hours agorootparentprevCouldn&#x27;t you do the same with tv shows and ads? reply comex 9 hours agorootparentAt least on iOS, not without hacking the operating system.

Under the granular permission control, your existing, granted permissions _should_ be revoked, but there&#x27;s no way you could know to revoke it. reply YeBanKo 1 hour agorootparentSomething like a plugin is a fairly well defined thing and ideally should not need a lot of permissions. E.g. an ad blocker has a simple flow: occasionally update filters from a number of specified endpoints and then match and block web pages’ request urls against downloaded lists. Between update it should have zero web traffic and filter updates are expected to be from known whitelisted sources and asymmetrical in size: very few bytes sends and a lot received. If all of a sudden after an update your plugin wants to send a bunch of data to a new URL you know immediately something is fishy. With respect to granularity, in this case the plugin might not even need to know the entire URL but just the host&#x2F;domain name - this makes it less attractive to adtech. replyjustsid 13 hours agoparentprevI really appreciate the transparency from you.

I noticed this already exists in Firefox (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mzl.la&#x2F;3Acn4DU), I don&#x27;t know of any auditors for Chrome extensions.Have some trusted organization or group (like Google or Mozilla themselves) who run audits on extensions to \"certify\" they don&#x27;t have any malware. Additionally, the extensions are all 100% open-source, so if the \"trusted organization\" is compromised (or just bad at their job), they&#x27;ll get caught and people will stop using them.This isn&#x27;t foolproof. Adware can be hidden from even the auditor or the auditor can be compromised but nobody finds out. It&#x27;s also expensive and time-consuming, especially for extensions with a lot of complex code, so many popular extensions which perfectly-fine are still not certified. Updates are delayed and discouraged because the diff always has to be audited as well. Lastly (and something which can easily be overlooked), the auditors can be biased towards approving some extensions (like those who pay them) while not approving others: extensions code won&#x27;t be approved if their code is too hard to read or they are later in the review queue, but the line at which code is considered \"too hard to read\" and their position in the queue could easily be influenced by cash.Nonetheless, web extensions are a good type of software to audit, compared to other software like apps. They&#x27;re often much smaller and simpler, users need much less, and they operate in a very-trusted domain (all web browing, including in banks and other confidential sites.

It&#x27;s the sound of a distant crypto-bro stampede coming your way! reply kmeisthax 11 hours agorootparentprevExtensions are centrally distributed on platforms that could at least nominally handle payment. The problem is that $0.01 is infinitely more expensive than free.In order for me to pay you, I at a minimum have to do some amount of mental gymnastics to convince myself that it&#x27;s worth it for me to pay you. This has a perceived cost even if the money spent is trivial. This is why people who take money in small increments - i.e. mobile games, arcade operators, casinos, and so on[0] have you buy a large amount of some scrip that they control, and then make it so easy to spend it that you might accidentally do so.Nobody is thinking \"I&#x27;d buy this, but only if I can leave no record of ownership[1]\", they&#x27;re thinking, \"is it actually worth buying\". Identity and privacy isn&#x27;t a thing that people actually account for when making purchases - mostly because it&#x27;s never actually mentioned[2] in the terms of purchase. It&#x27;s snuck in. So the choice is just \"the free one\" and \"the $2 one\", where the value of the $2 extension can never hope to overcome the mental transaction costs.[0] Nintendo and Microsoft used to do this around the Wii and 360 eras. While on the Wii it was 1 point equals 1 penny&#x2F;yen, Xbox did something nasty and made it 80 points equals 1 dollar.[1] That would mean that setting up a new computer or browser profile loses you all your existing extensions that you paid for.[2] I do not consider legal disclaimers to be adequate notice, and neither should you. Dropping a clause in a EULA is the equivalent of dropping rohypnol in your drink. reply mikeiz404 5 hours agorootparentprevIt also effectively has a minimum payment amount due to the credit card transaction fee structure.And also unlike cash a service can keep billing you.And, for better or worse, the risk is partially put on the business in the form of increased cost (or payment service denial) when a credit card transaction is considered too risky (charge backs).Also there is a fair amount of friction to giving payment info than say pulling out your wallet or phone (but this is improving with “digital wallets”). reply zamadatix 13 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve never had much a problem with informed decision. What rubs me the wrong way is when these apps hide the data monetization, require it, or don&#x27;t offer any way to use the service except to opt in. It particularly sucks for services I can&#x27;t even opt to not participate in, e.g. my work just went live with \"The Work Number\" service from Equifax so my data is already there whether or not I make an account. Even worse, not making an account just leaves it open that someone else might try to create an account as part of gathering even more involuntarily shared information about me.When it comes to what people chose to do with their own data though I don&#x27;t feel a moral obligation to push my views though. If they truly want to opt in and save the $20 (or however much the data is worth in the app) then taking that choice away because I disagree with how they should treat their privacy information is hardly much better than forcing them to because of the same reason. The main difference for me being whether or not I profit off it but, given choice in each case, that really doesn&#x27;t matter to how the user weighs the situation. reply imoreno 12 hours agoparentprev>They would gladly click on a \"sell my data\" over a \"pay money\" button any day of the week.Even though many people assume it&#x27;s this way, this choice hardly ever happens in practice. You allude to this yourself. In reality, the choices are usually between paying for something and they still sell your data, and getting it free and they really sell your data.The majority of paid services have privacy policies, terms of service and user agreements that spell out how they sell data just as much. At best, you might expect that they are a bit more selective in who they sell to, since they&#x27;re not as desperate for cash flow. However the impact to you is greater - they now have your credit card, address, full name, phone number (all vulnerable to hacks and leaks) and it&#x27;s harder to lie about these things than with a free account. So the data they collect is more valuable, hence the temptation is higher as well.Moreover, the paid services have consumer-hostile subscription systems rife with dark patterns. It&#x27;s needlessly tedious to cancel a service if you decide you don&#x27;t like it, and even free trials demand a credit card.Transparency is very low about what is actually done with your money as well. Many services operate at a loss, and the customer charge is just a fig leaf while the real money comes from investors. Arguably, the paid model is a sham for some companies and their real exit is to collect data for a years and then get bought by some data aggregator. On the other end of the spectrum you have people fishing for suckers with ridiculously inflated prices.For these reasons the choice of paying money is tainted by lack of trust, it is not just consumers being stingy and entitled. Lack of trust can quickly bog down any market.I don&#x27;t really blame the industry here, though. It&#x27;s a bit like California in 1848 - you can hardly blame people for picking up the gold that&#x27;s just lying around. The real problem is that we don&#x27;t have the tools, infrastructure and regulatory frameworks that let users see and control how their data is used. If people really want to sell their data in lieu of payment, then let them. But currently, most users are not aware exactly what data gets collected and how much it is worth - they&#x27;re not able to rationally decide that paying $5 for an app is better than being mined for $20 worth of your data. reply eviks 12 hours agoparentprevThe solution of for the app store owner to develop a better monetization scheme that would reward developers+ track change of ownership+ some distributed review system+ better sandboxing+ no forced autoupdates+ A few other things reply Firmwarrior 11 hours agorootparentMan, that would be niceWorld of Warcraft has an in game ui addon modding system built in that ends up suffering from these same problems.

The problem I was solving was how to make money from an extension that I publish. I was outlining different business models where you could give the user access to the extension, and make money without having to accept this arrangement with data thieves. reply sorokod 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see this as problem that needs to be solved. It is freeware from the start.It&#x27;s wonderful that people are willing to share their knowledge and time for free - why not let it be the way it is? reply jabradoodle 13 hours agorootparentPerverse incentives being one, you make the extension for free, for the purpose of selling out later.Project being maintained by a single dev being another, there needs to be incentive to keep the project going and not abondon or sell out. reply bavarianbob 14 hours agorootparentprevI believe problem isn&#x27;t the right word. I think OP is challenging your assumption that it&#x27;s inherently freeware. There are methods for monetizing an extension and they&#x27;re infrequently used or associated with a much larger experience (e.g. my BitWarden extension is critical for using BitWarden, but I pay for BitWarden&#x27;s subscription elsewhere). reply hamburglar 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, most extension devs probably start out with no intentions of profit. They wrote their extension to scratch an itch. However, once they get an installed base and start getting offers to do shady stuff, it seems obvious that they might be tempted by easy money. If they had a more legitimate way to make money, they may be less tempted by the shady stuff. reply sorokod 14 hours agorootparentThat is indeed obvious but I&#x27;d argue that in this case the problem is weak moral spine. Fortifying it with money will not make it go away. replyhot_gril 11 hours agoparentprevMight at least make these attacks harder if users could disable extension updates, or had to opt into them. Most of these extensions are simple and don&#x27;t really need to be updated, yet the update mechanism is silent full auto bada bing bada boom no rollbacks. I can&#x27;t think of any updates more aggressive, not even Steam. reply danShumway 11 hours agorootparentYet another opportunity to recommend Firefox to readers.I&#x27;m not sure I advise doing it, but you can go to about:addons and hit the gear icon and you can uncheck \"Update Addons Automatically\". Even better, click on an extension and under the \"details\" tab there&#x27;s an option per-addon to set whether you want automatic updates or not, so you can disable updates just for the one addon you don&#x27;t trust (or enable updates just for the one addon you do trust).Also, want to run older version of an extension? The Mozilla Addons page for each extension has a list of every release and you can download each version independently as a signed XPI file if you want to sideload it.The big thing I wish Mozilla would add is self-compiled releases like F-Droid does, especially since their ill-advised signing process means it&#x27;s hard for users to compile an extension from source -- it&#x27;s way too easy for a submitted extension to deviate from its source code. But that (admittedly large) issue aside, Firefox offers a lot of control for users who want to manage their own extension versions. Forced automatic updates are a Chrome problem. reply hot_gril 11 hours agorootparentYeah, that&#x27;s very nice. The only reason I&#x27;m even aware of how Chrome does it is because we&#x27;re forced to use Chrome at work. We&#x27;re allowed to use some vetted internal extensions with it, and I do, but someone pushed an update that broke an extension by accident. Then I was like, why is this a thing. reply variadix 10 hours agorootparentprevThanks for mentioning this reply ezekg 14 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think this is necessarily true. I run a software licensing API with quite a handful of customers running browser extensions with respectable user bases.So there are monetization opportunities, just like any other distribution channel. reply 6DM 15 hours agoparentprevI think the only way is to treat access like we do web apps, then enable&#x2F;disable features accordingly.That&#x27;s kinda lame because now you have to have a backend setup, just so you can charge for some features. reply Chabsff 15 hours agorootparentThe issue with that is that \"Gets to read and&#x2F;or write the DOM\" happens to be the only permissions a nefarious extension needs while also being those that a vast number of useful extensions require. reply 6DM 15 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re thinking from the browser level. I was thinking from the standpoint of what I could do as an extension developer.If we approach it from that angle, then your extension can only restrict access to it&#x27;s features via a round trip to your own servers to validate access and&#x2F;or show a checkout view to purchase access. reply jcparkyn 11 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s why it&#x27;d be nice to have a general \"access the internet\" permission, since DOM reads are usually harmless if they can&#x27;t get any data back. reply danShumway 11 hours agorootparentI suspect it would be a very hard permission to implement. There are a lot of ways to exfiltrate data from a website if you have DOM access. But yeah, agreed.Some of the difficulty around securing extensions boils down to the fact that Javascript permissions could be better. Websites do a decent job of sandboxing the website, but sandboxing within websites (without relying on iframes) is much more difficult.Per-site permissions and click-to-activate are also really useful features here. It&#x27;s easy to forget how recent they are. But it would be good to go further if possible and having barriers in front of exfiltration would be a big part of that -- there are many browser permissions that would become less dangerous if you could know for sure that the data they generate can&#x27;t get off your device. I just think it would be really difficult to try and build browser permissions around that in a user-legible way. reply brucethemoose2 14 hours agoparentprevThe root problem is that extensions are such a good platform for ads&#x2F;tracking.If monetization was better, it would just end up like Google Play, with adtech spam crowding out the \"legitimately\" monetized apps.Dracionian restrictions on web access (like requiring a prompt whenever an extension wants to upload&#x2F;download data) might help a little. reply jshier 12 hours agoparentprevYou can easily monetize Safari extensions by selling them through the App Store. reply lapcat 12 hours agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t say \"easily\", but you can. reply butz 14 hours agoparentprevGoogle could easily find a way to display ads for all extensions: pre-roll ads before extension launches, mid-roll ads when user is using extension for some period of time; not sure what is stopping them. reply ZephyrBlu 14 hours agoprevThis one is interesting because it seems harmless, if not even helpful (Monitoring DNS errors).

You can either use our script or collect the data on your own and send it to us via an FTP server, API etc. There’s a lot of different ways we can do this. We pay on a monthly basis.

Then give each one an office. By Megan McArdle ColumnistFollow August 9, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EDT (Washington Post staff illustration; iStock) Listen 5 min Share Comment 1420 Last month, I wrote a column suggesting that young women should think twice before taking “lazy girl jobs” — jobs that entail entirely remote work and place few demands on workers’ time or attention. Such jobs have obvious appeal in the short term. But remote workers don’t build the skills and connections that can help them one day get a better job. They’re also probably at higher risk of getting laid off when the next recession hits. Make sense of the news fast with Opinions' daily newsletter Predictably, this earned me the ire of folks who saw a libertarian columnist taking the side of capital over labor. Why aim the critique at young women who are hunting for a little work-life balance, rather than the employers who want to monopolize our time? All right, let me now offer some advice to employers who want their workers back in the office: Why not give those workers offices worth returning to? And I mean this literally: offices. Not open floor plans where people can hear every word, sneeze and gum-chew that comes from a co-worker’s mouth. Nor dispiriting cubicles that make them feel like rats in a maze. But small rooms with desks and doors that close. Advertisement Now, I’m not suggesting that the annoyances of open offices are the only reason workers don’t want to return to the office. After all, you can’t wear your pajamas in the office. You can’t walk the dog in the middle of the day or run to the kitchen to get dinner started. And no matter how nicely appointed, offices are a very inconvenient distance from one’s bed. Follow Megan McArdle's opinions Follow But the open office certainly doesn’t help make workers want to come back. It is, as aforementioned, noisy, which makes it difficult to do any work that requires sustained concentration. Yet somehow, an open office also makes one reluctant to chat with co-workers or make important telephone calls, knowing that every word will have an audience of dozens, some of them visibly annoyed that your chitchat is derailing their train of thought. Tightly spaced desks in open offices also often feel cramped; everyone has just enough room to type without jostling elbows. Bosses are presumably well aware of these drawbacks, since so many of them arrange to have, you know, offices. Surely, they can understand how employees might find offices enticing, too. Advertisement Yet already, I can hear upper management screaming. Offices for everyone? How will we manage workers we can’t see? What about all the collaboration we’ll lose when people are shut away behind closed doors? What about the cost? If you want to watch your employees work, build glass walls. As for collaboration, yes, the benefits of in-person work look substantial: In addition to fostering team spirit, it seems to help workers acquire skills, and, over the long run, it probably boosts productivity. Even Zoom, the backbone of remote work, is now demanding its employees come into the office a couple days a week. But it’s hardly clear that workers need to be practically on top of one another to reap these gains. In fact, excessive closeness might be a detriment: In a 2018 study, researchers used digital devices to record actual interactions between co-workers before and after their firm switched from cubicles to an open floor plan. They found that face-to-face interactions actually decreased by about 70 percent. That’s on top of the other concentration-wrecking, morale-sapping, stress-inducing, potentially disease-spreading side effects of tearing down the walls. Advertisement As for the cost — aye, there’s the rub. While a belief in the profit-enhancing power of collaboration was one reason for adopting open offices, it was not the only one. Employers also liked that you can pack a lot more desks into an open floor plan than into a place with walls; plus, you don’t have to pay someone to build the walls. But the remote work revolution actually makes this tradeoff less painful for the wily manager who is willing to give workers some space and privacy if the boost to productivity outweighs the cost. Because right now, the cost of extra space is falling. As other employers use remote work to downsize their space, owners of commercial properties are facing what Curbed recently dubbed an “office apocalypse.” The site reports that 5 Times Square, formerly “a gleaming centerpiece of 42nd Street’s revival,” is “currently close to empty.” It’s not the only one, and that’s starting to cut into office rental rates. In a report last month on the effects of hybrid work, McKinsey & Company predicted that this effect “will only worsen over the next seven years.” This will be awful for commercial landlords, their banks and their cities’ tax bases. But cheaper real estate presents an opportunity for employers with vision. Rather than try to threaten or cajole their way to the productivity-boosting benefits of in-person work, they can bring their workers together by giving them space to keep apart.

Then give each one an office (washingtonpost.com) 735 points by fortran77 20 hours ago| hidepastfavorite758 comments mytailorisrich 19 hours agoPeople who like WFH will never want to return to the office unless perhaps the office is a 5 minute walk from home (they may be forced to, but they won&#x27;t want to). For many people the time and cost savings of avoiding a daily commute cannot be offset by a nicer office.Those who are happy to return to the office in general are those who do not like WFH and prefer more contacts and a change of scenery.A nicer office makes things better but it will not change people&#x27;s minds on WFH. reply steveBK123 19 hours agoparentMy vaguely populist take is that the pandemic, WFH&#x2F;remote and hybrid gave the mass white collar class a taste of what the C-suite has had for years.. flexibility.Sure, these guys might go into the office but they do so from their pied-a-terre &#x2F; 3rd home &#x2F; whatever within a 5 minute chauffeured drive. They do this while maintaining a nearby suburban&#x2F;exurban estate and maybe a lake&#x2F;beach&#x2F;ski houses where they spend the majority of their actual hours.I was listening to a podcast and they observed that US commuters might have had a boiled frog scenario where you slowly just get used to having a worse & worse commute as you age.. and COVID snapped everyone out of it cold turkey. Now attempting to go back to it is revolting for many. reply steveBK123 19 hours agorootparentMy favorite story on this thread is that during the hybrid period, GS CEO threw a fit when out in the Hamptons because some analyst (fairly junior role almost at the bottom) had the balls to go introduce themselves during a workday lunch at a restaurant.He couldn&#x27;t articulate a specific, valid complaint like \"I was out at a client lunch and they were goofing off\" or \"I was on a vacation day while they were supposed to be working\".He was just mad that underlings had the same flexibility that he, as CEO, had always had. This being the same CEO who jets around DJing on the side for fun and has connections to do so at pretty high levels. So even the \"cool CEO\" is in fact, NOT cool.It&#x27;s like getting mad at all the other idiots on the road making traffic, lol. What do you think you are? reply dustincoates 18 hours agorootparentBecause I was curious, here&#x27;s what I found on the Goldman CEO story: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;newsletters&#x2F;2021-03-15&#x2F;goldma... reply steveBK123 18 hours agorootparentTo put some numbers on it \"Associate\" is a $150-$250K TC role vs DJ CEO making $25M. reply HWR_14 17 hours agorootparentIn real numbers, it&#x27;s a DJ ($5k) CEO ($25MM). reply steveBK123 17 hours agorootparentYes, but the funny thing is that.. for a guy worried about how hard his worker bees are working &#x2F; how focussed they were during COVID.. he dropped A LOT of tracks during COVID.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;David_M._SolomonIn fact, almost his entire track history was during COVID.. in a time that the company he runs has had some headline-grabbing losses in their consumer division.So I think its fair to say he should focus on his own productivity here first. reply caseyohara 16 hours agorootparentDid Solomon actually produce those tracks though? I always assumed it was a ghost producer. reply steveBK123 15 hours agorootparentHe flies around doing live sets, so maybe? reply TheOtherHobbes 15 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;d be surprised how often \"live set\" is a synonym for \"USB stick.\"The scene is notorious for it. It&#x27;s really not hard to find vids of DJs dancing, pointing, posing, and poking uselessly at a mixer which is obviously just there for the look. reply caseyohara 14 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s also a huge difference between a \"live set\" and a \"DJ set\". I&#x27;m surprised people here on HN don&#x27;t realize this.A \"live set\" typically involves the performer playing synths and programming the drums live. There are no record players, no pre-recorded tracks, everything is played live on the fly. Example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cVFzblT5VPE?t=4177 (a daytime one so you can see the gear)With a \"DJ set\", the DJ is playing two or more tracks, beatmatching them and mixing them together, transitioning from one track to the next. This still takes a lot of skill. If you see two or more turntables or media players and a mixer in the middle, that&#x27;s a DJ set. Often the DJ brings their tracks to the venue loaded on a USB stick and plugs it into the media player. Just because there&#x27;s a USB stick present doesn&#x27;t mean the DJ set was pre-recorded. Example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Ubyd98XV5C0?t=1018 reply haldujai 15 hours agorootparentprevDoes he do live sets (realizing the definitions are loose but essentially creating music live with something like an Ableton) as opposed to DJ sets (basically mixing pre-recorded tracks live, what most DJ performances are)?I&#x27;ve never seen him perform but a DJ set ranges from people who just hit the play button and follow a recipe (e.g. Paris Hilton) to very technical mixing (e.g. Maceo Plex). A live set is substantially more challenging (and why few do it) but would be strong support he&#x27;s not having his released tracks ghost produced.Either way, good for him in my opinion. I also like mixing as a creative outlet but am terrible at it. If I was worth 9 figures I&#x27;d probably get a ghost producer to help me out and enjoy the experience of DJing.David Solomon only really pitches himself as a hobbyist anyway so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything misleading&#x2F;shameful about it if he is in fact just getting everything ghost produced and doing a &#x27;lite&#x27; mixing DJ set live. There are plenty of full-time \"professional\" DJs who do the same thing. reply imwillofficial 14 hours agorootparentprevAs a former pro DJ and having seen Him live.

Still a side gig, but not quite as trivial especially when his CEO pay isn’t directly tied to hours worked.“His Spotify profile has 550,000 monthly listeners with his debut single garnering 8 million listens.”It varies but this list is showing several people at close to 1$&#x2F;year per monthly listener. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.internetdj.com&#x2F;top-djs reply dbbk 11 hours agorootparentprevHe DJs as a hobby, people are allowed to have hobbies, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s relevant. reply flandish 18 hours agorootparentprevThis example is a stark reminder that the complaints are most often not about details but about class.The CEO was upset others were allowed to perform as if they were of the same class.It’s always class when one boils it down, imho. reply steveBK123 18 hours agorootparentPrecisely. He couldn&#x27;t put it into words because the words wouldn&#x27;t have looked good.But the obvious complaint was what are these slobs doing in my summer resort town, dining in the same establishment as me!! Rather than stuck in downtown Manhattan in the August heat. Or - the least they could do is go to Coney Island &#x2F; Jones Beach &#x2F; Jersey Shore or something eating some hotdogs. reply gitfan86 18 hours agorootparentI have not run into this attitude in tech from executives. Finance is much more of a heiracy culture I guess.I have run into this at a peer level though. I&#x27;ve negotiated WFH and extra vacation and have learned to keep it in the down low. They get mad at me, but I&#x27;m not the one that is their boss and I couldn&#x27;t care less if they WFH. reply ghaff 18 hours agorootparentIt certainly varies. I&#x27;ve had a casual relationship with senior execs (subject of course to understanding that they get to make the decisions at the end of the day). However, I&#x27;ve heard the stories about some senior execs that are of the mindset of \"Don&#x27;t make eye contact with me unless you&#x27;ve been spoken to.\" I didn&#x27;t quite believe it at first because it&#x27;s never been my experience but it&#x27;s a thing.I haven&#x27;t taken a month-long vacation for a while but when I did a few times in a long-ago role, there were definitely people who were at least a bit incredulous that I could get off with doing so. reply benterix 15 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s never been my experience but it&#x27;s a thingYes it is a thing. It starts when you get promoted to a more senior role. The thing is, nothing much changed inside or outside, so many people feel they need to make a point. They start to dress differently, behave differently, introduce distance - to make sure others understand who is in the \"superior\" position.I noticed thin in insecure types or those who need some confirmation of their value. But there are many people who are exact opposites, especially in the younger generation. They understand that being a manager doesn&#x27;t mean giving orders but supporting your team in their work. It&#x27;s so much easier for everybody. reply ryandrake 14 hours agorootparentThere are executive-class perks in most medium-to-large companies, but at least in tech, they&#x27;re kept on the down low so you have to kind of look for them to find them. Personal assistants are probably the most visible. Private meeting rooms &#x2F; bathrooms &#x2F; entrances for the executives, chauffeurs, cooks, masseuses, access to corporate jets, hard-to-get tickets to sporting &#x2F; arts events, separate housing allowances and company-paid villas, personal security, lots of financial perks like wealth management tools, free tax services, deferred comp and supplemental retirement savings. But these things don&#x27;t tend to get flashed in front of the worker-bees. reply benterix 19 minutes agorootparent> they&#x27;re kept on the down low so you have to kind of look for them to find themThat&#x27;s basically my point. selimthegrim 14 hours agorootparentprevI thought it was understood executive bathrooms are for the hookers and blow. reply hgsgm 11 hours agorootparentprevAlmost all of those perks have been given to line techies since Google was founded. reply steveBK123 18 hours agorootparentprevSmall biz bros are worse. My wife left finance to work for a small (50-200) person business for a few years. Couple brothers that inherited it from daddy.

There&#x27;s a lot of this in northern Italy, which is actually a pretty productive, wealthy area. But they&#x27;d be better off if there was more consolidation and some new blood. Tons of companies where grandpa founded it after WWII, and worked his hands to the bone. The son inherited it, maybe went to college and grew it and improved it some, and the grandkids are all about booze and cars and women.OTOH, a good small company can be really good. Decisions get made quickly, you know most of the people and can talk with them, much less BS, and more of a sense of purpose in what you&#x27;re doing there rather than being a cog. I worked in one a few years back and loved it. They are tough to find, though, as a real &#x27;small company&#x27; is different than a startup in that they&#x27;re a bit less crazy in terms of growth. reply ghaff 18 hours agorootparentprevSmall businesses can have their own set of issues which are probably different than those you encounter at a big company but they can be just as bad or worse. (Oh, and if you&#x27;re in business for yourself, you need to do a lot of selling and need to deal with clients directly.) reply flandish 18 hours agorootparentprevHave seen similar. IMHO it falls under the umbrella HR created to keep us from discussing salary, too. A completely legal (US) thing employees can do. reply derefr 17 hours agorootparentprevNot even. He was upset because the presence of his middle-class employee in his previously-upper-class restaurant — especially with the employee visibly performing middle-class behaviors like a lack of consideration of discretion (and then not being told to sit down by the restaurant staff!) — was tarnishing the restaurant&#x27;s upper-class image, i.e. the usefulness of using eating there as an upper-class shibboleth.Or, to put that another way: if the CEO can&#x27;t use \"come eat with me at $place\" as a way to say to investors and other CEOs that he&#x27;s \"one of them\" and can be let in on the backchannel conversations, then why is he even eating there? It&#x27;s expensive and the service is awful! He&#x27;d much rather not! Now he needs to find a new place to use to signal that! reply nebula8804 13 hours agorootparentI would love to hear the \"backchannel\" conversations happening between people like Musk, Altman, the Google guys and their cronies. It often \"feels\" like they are planning something nefarious longterm but I can&#x27;t exactly see the big picture so im not sure. reply BerislavLopac 1 hour agorootparentI thought that it is quite obvious: a \"new aristocracy\", separate from the \"masses\" and protected by the law while not held accountable by it. It&#x27;s not quite that there is a \"master plan\" and coordinated \"conspiracy\" -- it&#x27;s simply that the humans have a tendency to protect themselves by isolating from \"others\". And when you have the wealth and power, this separation quickly becomes very unbalanced.In Middle Ages, this separation was based on ownership of land and societal structure which soon started being formalised in (both religious and secular) laws. Today, money has the same purpose (being a measure and store of wealth). reply Macha 13 hours agorootparentprevThe sad thing is that when it&#x27;s come out (e.g. the twitter court case), it&#x27;s been shockingly vapid.

It&#x27;s like Musk demanding everyone comes into the office while he is only in the office at individual companies 1 or 2 times a week. CEO of Tesla, a publicly traded company spends all his time in the privately held offices of Twitter. Can other of his company employees work multiple jobs including their own personal company?If the answer is no then it&#x27;s 100% a class thing reply notfromhere 13 hours agorootparentThe funniest bit to me is that Musk owning and working as the CEO of multiple companies is admitting that CEOs don’t actually do much tangible work. reply hughesjj 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s even funnier when the companies he has the least day to day involvement in operate better.Musk buying Twitter was the best thing to happen to the work culture of Tesla employees. reply hgsgm 11 hours agorootparentprevHe bought the company from Jack Dorsey, who did the absentee CEO thing first. reply FredPret 18 hours agorootparentprevNot everything is a class dynamic. “Analyst at GS hanging out in the Hamptons” doesn’t scream working class.The CEO and analyst are both upper class, just different levels of power and seniority.That CEO is just a power-tripping asshole. reply gochi 18 hours agorootparentHave you heard of phrases like \"old money\" and \"new money\"? Or \"upper middle\" and \"lower upper\"?The reason they&#x27;re used more is because there is a very clear distinction between groups even at high levels of wealth due to the need to socially signal. This is what causes CEOs to flip out that an analyst is trying to casually talk to them at a non-work event as if they are equals.This is class dynamics in action, it&#x27;s not all about the working class vs upper class, but how these different classes interact internally and externally. reply vasco 14 hours agorootparentPeople like to find ways to feel superior to others regardless of how much money they have. Money is just one of the easiest and most transversal ways.But feeling like you have better opinions or thought deeper about subjects than others or that you know \"how it really is\", or that you&#x27;re a better driver or whatever are other common ways. Whatever you feel like you are good at, or have a lot of, you will be tempted to feel superior about.Fighting these thoughts is virtuous in my opinion. Pretending that only X type of people do it (rich or whatever) is not virtuous in my opinion. reply afiori 15 hours agorootparentprevThere can be many class horizons, it could very possibly be that the young analyst would dislike a plumber (as in someone owning a plumbing comapany) talking casually to him, the plumber a retail casher, the retail casher an homeless person.Upper vs working the most important divide (IMHO), but not the only one. reply hgsgm 11 hours agorootparentprevCEO is New Money. Analyst is Not Money. reply ElFitz 18 hours agorootparentprevA 150k-250k analyst isn’t upper class. Nor is it really middle-class (although that would depend on the cost of living).It’s that weird in-between, where one still needs to earn a living and make even more money for someone else.A 25M &#x2F; year CEO is far past \"earning a living\" and really only works because they want to. reply mytailorisrich 17 hours agorootparentA junior analyst at Goldman Sachs who&#x27;s having lunch in the Hamptons, in a restaurant the CEO also goes to, is probably upper class, just very young&#x2F;recenly graduated though we don&#x27;t know the details.Social class is not just about your current salary, although 200k soon after graduation isn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;average&#x27;...Some might even say that walking up to the CEO like that indicates upper class self-assurance... reply steveBK123 16 hours agorootparentTaking the other side - the junior was out to lunch with a bunch of coworkers.In the office setting the CEO would never been seen anywhere near the same floor that such junior people are working or eating, never having the opportunity to introduce themselves. One bank famously had a special CEO elevator so the guy could seamlessly get from the garage to his high-rise executive suite without bumping into a single soul.I recently found myself out to dinner a table over from a C-suite exec at my company. I did not introduce myself because I&#x27;m a socially damaged introvert.It&#x27;s a pretty easy bet that the kid was a major extrovert on the other hand, more than some assumption they must already be upper class.You&#x27;d be surprised about the class mobility on Wall St vs other industries. When I graduated, Google famously did not even recruit from anything other than a small handful of schools and screened out a pretty high GPA minimum like 3.75 or so. Meanwhile every bank came to my college and I had like 5 offers. A good number of my coworkers spent some time at community college, had parents without college degrees, are first gen immigrants, etc.Outside of glad-handing networking roles that lean on peoples connections like in IB, \"already rich\" is the exception rather than the rule. Bear was famous for saying they didn&#x27;t hire MBAs, but instead PSDs — poor, smart and had a deep desire to be rich reply notfromhere 12 hours agorootparentFinance is kind of unique is that it’s a weird mix of a strict meritocracy and a deeply seated upper crust that’s incredibly nepotistic.The meritocrats are the ones that work the jobs where they actually have to make money and profits. Nepos are shunted to roles where that isn’t as direct. reply sheepscreek 5 hours agorootparentprevI like to believe the analyst likely came from money. The son of another executive possibly? Which would explain why he was at this restaurant in the Hamptons. And likely why he didn’t flinch to introduce himself. reply freetanga 17 hours agorootparentprevCould be family money.

It covers a huge breadth of the population but that&#x27;s better anyway imo reply CapstanRoller 8 hours agorootparentprevNo, it never meant that. \"Middle class\" is a USAmerican invention, and an incoherent one at that.Class is defined by one&#x27;s relationship to the means of production (e.g. whether you work in a factory, or own the factory where people work) reply rayiner 16 hours agorootparentprevThis recent (and self-serving) tendency of reducing “class” to only the extremely wealthy and everyone else is reductive and obscures important economic dynamics. It’s ridiculous to treat a master plumber that owns a plumbing business as “bourgeoise” while treating an Amazon engineer who has tremendous human capital as being a “proletariat.” Even in Marx’s time, there was substantial debate about how to classify the salaried professionals that served as the agents of the capital owners.In the modern economy, capital owners are reliant on a class of non-fungible white collar workers that bring their own human capital. The two groups have myriad common interests. Those interests are in many cases in opposition to those of ordinary workers who lack human capital and are fungible and easily replaced. reply kevinventullo 15 hours agorootparentYou think software engineers aren’t fungible? Facebook hires SWE’s based on generic technical interviews and doesn’t even assign them a team until week six. reply rayiner 15 hours agorootparentThat just means they’re not literally irreplaceable, not that they’re fungible. The pool of people who could do the job, even with training, is a tiny fraction of the overall population. reply austhrow743 12 hours agorootparentGold is rare too. reply notfromhere 12 hours agorootparentprevWell paying engineers is more of a function of US dynamics in tech. Engineering salaries are down to earth basically everywhere else.They’re proles by the definition of how they earn their labor. If the pool of labor expands beyond the available roles, those high salaries would crash down. reply ElFitz 7 hours agorootparentprevIf you want to get pedantic, we could more precisely define the upper-class as those who extract value from others, and the lower classes as those from which said value is extracted from.Were we to push that to the extreme, the only upper-class at Goldman Sachs would be retirees, either as direct shareholders or as beneficiaries of some pension fund. Even if they were lower middle-class Americans living in an old aging house they can’t afford to fix.That would be the Value Extraction definition of Class.Others would argue that class is more diffuse, and that one’s class depends more on their family&#x27;s history, where they went to school, and who they know, than on how much they have. Which is a valid point.That would be a Social Capital definition of Class.I doubt however that anyone would consider a street-sweeping former Emperor (eg Piyin), or some penniless heir to some old industry dynasty as still belonging to any sort of upper-class.Meaning the actual definition actually is some fluid mix of the two. That and probably some other definitions I’m not even aware of.> In the modern economy, capital owners are reliant on a class of non-fungible white collar workers that bring their own human capital.It’s nothing modern. Capital owners always have, since the first scribe, and probably before that (see Japan’s former hordes of perpetually desk-bound samurai).Still, let’s entertain the argument. I’ll use, and I’m truly sorry for that, a tired analogy.In the modern world, many people are reliant on many different types of usually non-fungible pets and somewhat fungible, depending on who you ask, animals, for many different purposes. Some of which bring their own highly sought-after hard-earned skills.Let’s limit ourselves to the oh so tired dog analogy.A person and their dog have myriad common interests. Those interests are, in many cases, in opposition to those of many other people and animals. Even more so when said dog is considered a family member, serves as a guard dog, as a shepherd dog, or is specialised in drugs detection.Does that make them equal? Does that change anything to the fact that one is extracting value from the other, and often only pays them back in dog food, usually made from our food industry’s literal scraps and refuse?So yes, I agree with you: there’s no simple and definitely no simplistic definition of class.I am still convinced however that, in the specific and limited context of the comment I was replying to, the one I used was good enough. reply rayiner 4 hours agorootparentA farmer’s dog may be eating the scraps, but has a fundamentally different role in the farm as an enterprise than the animals the dog is herding.By your value-extraction definition, Sundar Pichai isn’t upper class. He doesn’t make money from his ownership of the capital—he owns a negligible share of Alphabet. Instead, he helps the shareholders extract more value from Alphabet and is compensated for that work. A definition that excludes CEOs from the upper class isn’t a very workable one.I think a more useful definition recognizes that, in between shareholders and the workers is a class of people who help the shareholders extract more value from the enterprise, and therefore has interests closely aligned with those of the shareholders. For example in a company like Uber, that’s what the programmers are doing. They’re not creating value, they’re building systems to extract more value from the drivers.Another way to look at it is that there’s a large class of people whose jobs wouldn’t be nearly as well compensated without monopolistic capitalism. $500,000&#x2F;year Facebook engineers only exist because Facebook as an enterprise throws off enormous amounts of cash. If you look at more social-democratic societies, the biggest difference isn’t at the very top. Sweden and Norway have more billionaires per capita than the United States. Instead, the biggest difference is in the professional class. Swedish engineers (and bankers and lawyers and other professionals) make a fraction of what their American counterparts make. And that’s because Sweden has far fewer of these insanely high margin businesses. reply ElFitz 2 hours agorootparent> A farmer’s dog may be eating the scraps, but has a fundamentally different role in the farm as an enterprise than the animals the dog is herding.And yet they are both animals, often get treated as less than most people, the shepherd dog only gets the proverbial scraps. Precisely the analogy’s entire point. I’m Glad I didn’t have to spell it out.> A definition that excludes CEOs from the upper class isn’t a very workable one.Absolutely. Hence the \"Were we to push that to the extreme\", followed by a ridiculous application of the definition.> Another way to look at it is that there’s a large class of people whose jobs wouldn’t be nearly as well compensated without monopolistic capitalism.And thus we can differentiate those of these people who are part of the upper class from those who aren’t by wether they get an actual share of the value they produce, or merely scraps. Wether they are compensated as equals, or as useful tools.Interesting bit about Sweden and Norway. I didn’t know that. reply melagonster 6 hours agorootparentprevyou mentioned that extremely wealthy, I don&#x27;t think any plumber can have extremely wealthy. reply steveBK123 18 hours agorootparentprevActually its extra funny because he is, objectively, a pretty bad CEO! Probably the worst GS has ever had. He will not last much longer in the seat.The big push into consumer finance has been a complete multi-billion loss making debacle under his leadership. reply skissane 18 hours agorootparentprev> The CEO and analyst are both upper classClass can be more fine-grained than just lower&#x2F;working-middle-upperPeople commonly talk about “upper middle class” vs “lower middle class”, and then I suppose there are even some people in between the two (middle middle class?)Well, in the same way there is surely lower upper class and upper upper class, and maybe even more levels than that. A person on an annual salary of US$25 million is undeniably upper class but still far beneath the centibillionaire class.There’s also no clear boundary between upper middle and lower upper. You may think someone on US$250K is “upper class” but they probably only think of themselves as “upper middle class”, and personally I would think the same. In my own head, to really be upper class, your annual income has to be (consistently) measured in millions, not hundreds of thousands. reply ryandrake 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve always thought all those granular \"upper lower upper class\" and \"middle lower upper class\" and \"upper middle upper lower middle class\" distinctions were pretty pointless and mainly are for the people who care deeply about constructing a societal totem pole and placing everyone precisely somewhere on that totem pole.The huge class divides are not between retail workers, tradesmen and software developers, the divide is between C-suite executives &#x2F; old money, and... everyone else who has to work for a living.As a tech worker, I have far more in common lifestyle-wise with a schoolteacher than I do with the SVP of Engineering in my own company. reply OJFord 8 hours agorootparentYou can be broke and upper class; rich and &#x27;working&#x27;. Economists&#x2F;historians&#x2F;et al. call it socioeconomic class: I think the latter dominates in the US, and the former in the UK.

I am aware of the differences between social class as it is in the UK and economic class. I should have specified I&#x27;m talking about American-style economic class.In the US, working class tends to mean people in food service, retail sales, low-skill manual labor, people relying on gig work, and some very low-level white-collar workers like secretaries. Upper class are basically the very few people for whom work is optional. F500 CEOs, SVPs, billionaire investors, and so on. Their existing wealth grows at a rate that can sustain their and their family&#x27;s standard of living indefinitely.The rest is middle class, a very wide range from schoolteachers, to skilled tradesmen, to engineers, to university professors, to small business owners, to doctors and so on.My point is that people are nit-picking when they say things like \"Oh, but doctors are upper middle class and teachers are lower middle class and engineers are lower upper middle class and on and on and on. Distinction without a meaningful difference. reply skissane 8 hours agorootparent> Good point. I am aware of the differences between social class as it is in the UK and economic class.I think traditional concepts of social class count for a lot less in the UK of 2023 than they did in the UK of 1973. But wealth counts for just as much, even more.Were Rishi Sunak&#x27;s parents \"upper class\"?

Managers like the mentioned bank CEO, or someone who can rent them a house in the Hamptons because they have lived there for generations? An intellectual who has never really worked, or a wealthy rapper who didn&#x27;t finish high school? reply skissane 8 hours agorootparent> Who is more upper class, a relatively impoverished Prince of the Holy Roman Empire or a billionaire by marriage and luck?I think Western society has been undergoing a transition between two different class systems. (Marxists would surely connect this with the economic transitions from feudalism to mercantilism to early capitalism to late capitalism.)In the mediaeval class system, class was determined by social status which was predominantly inherited, and money alone was not enough to move from the bottom to the top. A person born poor might acquire great wealth, but they would still be locked out of the nobility&#x2F;aristocracy, unless the monarch deigned to ennoble them. An impoverished baron socially outranked the far wealthier merchant who was born into poverty and worked&#x2F;lucked their way out of it.In the late capitalist class system–all that really matters is your net worth. Everything else is secondary. Who cares who your parents were or where you come from once you have a billion dollars to your name – and if a billionaire is excluded socially, it is very likely due to something about their individual behaviour (see e.g Kanye–although I suppose he&#x27;s an ex-billionaire now), rather than their family background in itself.The transition between the two systems has been ongoing; it still hasn&#x27;t completely finished, but we&#x27;ve moved a lot closer to the late capitalist system, and a lot further away from the mediaeval system, than we were 50 or 100 years ago. I don&#x27;t think the transition proceeds at the same rate in every country either – I think the UK retains more of the old class system than most other places (although even in the UK it is a lot weaker than it used to be); it also arguably retains some strength in the northeastern US, although not to the same extent as the UK. reply thegaulofthem 18 hours agorootparentprevThey may both be richer than you (they’re certainly richer than I), but they’re definitely not of the same class. reply steveBK123 18 hours agorootparentYes, even well paid worker bees are still worker bees.The queen bee who owns a share of the hive, decides how many bees to hire&#x2F;fire, where they work, when they work, what % of the honey to share with the worker bees, etc.. now thats a different class. reply generic92034 16 hours agorootparentWhat about managers&#x2F;trainers of sports teams, if the stars of the team get a significantly higher salary?

A person on a US$20 million a year salary obviously isn’t working class or even middle class-they might truthfully say they are of “working&#x2F;middle class background” (if their parents were of more modest means)Whereas, their 10 year old kid whose annual income and assets are roughly $0 is also upper class-because their parents are. Now, if they grow up and their parents end up disowning them and they end up living on the streets homeless-then they won’t be upper class any more. But if that doesn’t happen, then they are-because even if they aren’t filthy rich yet, very likely they’ll eventually inherit a huge amount of money from their parents (assuming they don’t already have some kind of “you’ll never have to work a day in your life” trust fund set up for them).

As yogthos said in a different comment, differences in class are about having substantially different economic incentives. (I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as GP and say they are unrelated. Of course they are strongly correlated. But they are different things in fundamental ways). reply lancesells 17 hours agorootparentprevI think you&#x27;re thinking too much about the restaurant. A CEO can go have a $1000 meal at the same place the analyst has a $200 meal. The CEO could even have the $200 meal. Even multi-millionaires might not want a seven course prix fix for lunch.If the analyst lives in NYC and makes $250k they aren&#x27;t living large. If they went to an Ivy League school and have to pay for it they really aren&#x27;t living large. Regardless, the story makes the CEO look silly. reply yogthos 17 hours agorootparentprevThe only meaningful way to look at class is by looking at class interests. On the one hand, you have the capitalist class who own significant amount of capital and use this capital to further their wealth. On the other hand, you have working class people for whom selling their labour is the primary source of their income.These two classes have largely contradictory interests. People who own companies want to cut their costs, and therefore they want to lower wages, give lower benefits, less time off, and so on. Workers want the exact opposite of that.People such as CEOs constitute a labour aristocracy where their interests largely align with the interests of large capitalists and they own some capital of their own. reply hibikir 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s still more complicated than that, as ultimately a non trivial number of people end up making more from investments than labor, just from savings and time. Basically every 45 year old developer in the US that tried to save at all is a capitalist in your book.If capital gains hand someone 300k a year, they aren&#x27;t quite workers, but they aren&#x27;t playing the same game as someone who is still playing the accumulation game. It&#x27;s the best trick the late 20th century played: Defined contribution workers are all also capitalists, just like everyone relying on an ever more valuable house. reply yogthos 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that complicated actually. The basic question is whether the individual has to keep going to work to maintain their lifestyle. Pretty much every 45 year old developer out there wouldn&#x27;t last long without having a job. They probably have a mortgage to pay on their house, they have car payments, credit card debt, and so on. They&#x27;re not living off their capital even though they might own some capital.An actual capitalist makes a living by using their capital as the primary vehicle to create further wealth for themselves and to sustain their lifestyle.Again, the key distinction is in terms of class interests. What sort of social policies would be of interest to each type of individual is the question. reply kbos87 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is so often overlooked and it&#x27;s true.

The fact is that as remote work became more popular, with the increase in positions, pay has actually increased. I&#x27;m not surprised that more people are seeing pushback on in the office vs remote compensation as this has been the standard play for years.I find it doubly frustrating since remote employees are less of a cost sink due to less office space and all the costs that come with it. Remote employees are the most efficient type of employees from that perspective and so it always felt like such a flimsy excuse.My suggestion is push back on any perceived pay gap between in office and remote work. The work done is at parity (if not more so due to efficiencies of remote work) and so there is no valid excuse to pay less. reply Jcampuzano2 17 hours agorootparentprevThis.

But work from home is a good example if the fact that on many important dimensions, such as work conditions and generational mobility,[1] those groups are in the same class.[1] CEOs are obviously richer than say accountants of engineers.

The majority of the people I carted around were people who thought Uber was a godsend because they were too poor to save for a car, and Uber allowed them to have a job that didn&#x27;t involve manual or skilled labor they couldn&#x27;t perform. People like call center operators, and medical coders (which is not the same thing as computer coding), and other jobs that aren&#x27;t suitable for machines, and often done in a cube farm.The pandemic sent all those people into WFH, and many of their companies found that the price of equipping their people with a laptop and headset was cheaper than paying rent on cubical space.Now those working poor can put the expense of Uber into saving for a car, or buying clothes for their children, or any of the assorted other things that people need every day.For millions of people, WFH is a helping hand out of poverty. reply giantrobot 15 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t forget it can obviate the need for extremely expensive child care. Someone working 9-5 in an office doing the work you describe needs at least 2 hours of day care with 4 hours being closer to the average.

You might work for the restaurant owner, but your material interests aren’t aligned with those of the crabs.The wages versus capital distinction overlooks the nature of modern businesses, where ownership is diffuse, and businesses are run by a vast class of skilled professionals. For example, Tim Cook owns just 0.02% of Apple stock, but he runs the company. Many executives below him have tremendous power. Individual engineers can have a major impact on the direction of the whole business. Most importantly, the executive roles are typically filled from that same class of people.These people aren’t Steve Jobs in terms of their ownership interest in the company, but they’re not Apple Store workers either. Their self interest is fundamentally more aligned with those of the capitalists than with the interests of labor. reply toyg 18 hours agorootparentprevThe similarities are skin-deep. Managers are typically capital-owners; employees are not. Capital owners get to dictate societal priorities in a way that others will simply never be able to. reply rayiner 17 hours agorootparentCapital ownership is one distinction, but it’s not the only salient one. Other distinctions include, for example, whether your job generally benefits from communications technology and globalization.

I grew up always assuming there would be a long commute. I couldn&#x27;t afford to move out of my parents house for almost a year out of school in my first job (2008 making less than $30k&#x2F;yr) so I spent 7 or 8 months driving an hour each way. I&#x27;m too young to remember but my dad spent the first few years of my life and several before that commuting 2 hours one way.

Finally you maybe decide to start a family by 40, and move out to somewhere 40-60min commute, if not further.Each step is just a small increment worse.

It is not because they take a paltry 15 days paid time off per year in which they use those homes.

What I found recently, is employers are trying to shift from one extreme (fully remote) to the other. I hope we land back in the middle because I&#x27;m happiest when no one tells me what to do.

If enough people do this, coworking spaces will pop up more and more and compete to get the best deals.

Many employers will try lure workers away from the office with remote work. These firms may offset any hypothetical productivity costs with lower wages. Some engineers will prioritize remote for the larger employer pool, and others will prioritize in-person for greater social connection.We&#x27;ll see what happens in 20 years.

The simple social signal of the door being opened or close implying availability to chat works great to balancing heads down time and chat with colleagues time. Have a white board of your own that you can stare at throughout the course of a project, that evolves with discussions has not be replicated yet either remote or in a shared space.You can also get pretty wild with customizing an office for comfort. I used to know many people that brought their own lighting in, completely solving the problem of constant overhead fluorescence. And brewing your coffee the way you like it in your own space in the afternoon is very refreshing.Even given all that I&#x27;m sure many people would still prefer remote work (I would at this point), but I can image a fairly large number of people that would be very interested in a set up like this.

My commute was ~30mins with a motorcycle. Yes, sometimes the A&#x2F;C or the lighting must be compromised with other coworkers, but that&#x27;s still okay if you get to socialize in exchange.The major aspect was obviously noise.

I could close the door and go unbothered for hours. I turned off the lights and had my own lamp that was much more comfortable.Sharing an office with coworkers wasn&#x27;t bad on its face but it&#x27;s difficult to focus if the other person is talking with someone else. It&#x27;s all manageable but objectively worse than a single office. The open floor plan at Apple Park was just fucking horrible. Constant distractions all day. Sure you could collaborate but when trying to actually get work done it was in spite of a hundred visual and audible distractions.

The people who never come back to the office despite being allowed to are also the people who live the closest to the office. (We have a big office that allows people to come back but is totally optional. Hotel desks for the entire office basically.) I asked one of them why he doesn&#x27;t come in and he told me, \"The reason I moved so close to the office in the first place is so I can minimize my commute.

Another coworker told me, \"Do you know how great this is? I can do my laundry in between meetings.\"From my experience, my employer&#x27;s current situation is probably the most accommodating policy. If you want to work in an office, you can. If you don&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t have to. I do have coworkers who are actually suffering a bit from lack of interaction with other people but I think those people are starting to trickle back into the office for no other reason than for the socialization and interaction. reply marcosdumay 18 hours agorootparentA lot of people at my workplace use the office as a second \"base\" where they can settle for the day and is close to a lot of things.Since I live close to it, I never even though about doing this.

I’d probably show face at the obligate meetings then just go home for the day if I could. reply Cthulhu_ 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d do it because I think it&#x27;s better to have separate work &#x2F; life areas; right now my WFH spot is also my PC gaming spot and the bedroom and the place where laundry dries, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind more distance between work, leisure and private life.That said, five minutes means one could come home for lunch.But anyway, five minute walk to work is highly unlikely; a lot of people (most? citation needed?) have a commute to work, either driving or public transit. I&#x27;d rather have a nice private office or small team room than a big open and loud office space. reply Roark66 18 hours agorootparent>I&#x27;d do it because I think it&#x27;s better to have separate work &#x2F; life areas; right now my WFH spot is also my PC gaming spot and the bedroom and the place where laundry dries, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind more distance between work, leisure and private life.Long time ago I used to rent a room in a shared house 5 min walk from work. My housemates were all cool people, but working on a laptop sitting next to the bed I slept in every night would e far worse for me than just going to the office. But this was decades ago. I can understand why someone in such position would prefer an office.But if you can have a house, and you&#x27;re mid&#x2F;senior in your role there is nothing better than wfh.Also I&#x27;ve recently noticed a disturbing trend. Companies advertising 100% remote work, then you go through the whole recruitment process and at the very end they tell you. BTW, it&#x27;s not 100% wfh. You gotta come to the office 1 day per month (sometimes even 1 per week). Anyone looking for real wfh job should be aware of such tricks to nip them in the bud early on. reply screwturner68 18 hours agorootparentThere was a study about that and there was a direct correlational between the size of you home and your desire to return to the office, people with small apartments enjoyed the office much more than those with larger houses. I&#x27;d also guess that the people with larger homes live father away from work than people with smaller homes so a longer commute comes into play. reply brewdad 11 hours agorootparentThat makes total sense. My house is about 1900 sq ft over two levels. During lockdown, my wife converted our guest bedroom into her office. My HS aged son did online school in his bedroom and I basically had the entire downstairs. Our cats moved around throughout the day depending on their mood.This would have been much more uncomfortable in a smaller 2BR apartment and almost unmanageable in any space smaller than that. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 18 hours agorootparentprevI had to get a second desk in my place for WFH. It was way too jarring to log off and keep sitting in the same spot. Contextual learning made me feel awkward to browse Reddit “at work”.Given my space, my WFH desk is much crappier and smaller than my personal one, but still so much better than losing my life commuting. reply steveBK123 19 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s funny is my boss, a total hardo, during latter stages of COVID did live 5 minutes from work.He used it to his advantage to show his face in the office, but rarely ever put in a full day. So sure he might show up on reports as being a 2-3x&#x2F;week attender while others were doing 0-1, but many of those were morning-only, afternoon-only, or drop-ins for an in-person meeting of importance. Plus the occasional Friday solitude getaway to the empty office.To his credit he really put no RTO pressure on us relative to his management chain. reply freetanga 17 hours agorootparentI did what your boss did. WFH means that other people at your home might be there too, your wfh spot might be uncomfortable, and for me changing the scenery and getting some peace and quiet helped me productive. If I have a delicate call I don’t want my kids barging in telling me the Wifi is slow or my wife asking for dinner plans. Also, changing scenario helps me leaving problems at the door.I really don’t get when people defend WFH as a Holy Grail and complain that are catalogued as lazy or freeloaders, only to become fierce critics and cataloging anyone who prefers going to the office as boot-lickers or mediocre middle-management (not your post SteveBK123, but a common attitude across this type of thread)Everyone has different circumstances, different jobs, and our minds work differently. Let’s live and let live. reply shortrounddev2 19 hours agorootparentprevI used to live 5mins from work. The office catered lunch every day, but I still went home every day to eat lunch with my wife instead. Hated being at that place reply dack 19 hours agorootparenteven if you like the place, hard to beat lunch with the wife reply CoastalCoder 19 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t mean this as cras, but even better is \"lunch\" with the wife.I.e., when the two of you are finally home alone and awake, because school is in session.I suspect for some marriages, WFH has been a real blessing. reply lampshades 18 hours agorootparentAnd for other marriages, WFH has been a disaster. I know so many people who have ended up divorced after they were both WFH everyday. reply CoastalCoder 17 hours agorootparentYeah, it&#x27;s sad. I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that WFH was a net positive for every couple. reply MSFT_Edging 18 hours agorootparentprevI tell recruiters I want remote because there&#x27;s nothing better than seeing my wife or playing with my cat when I need to take a break. Every single recruiter understands completely. Some will push remote, others respectfully end the conversation because they know they cant beat that. reply screwturner68 18 hours agorootparentprevI lived 5 minutes away from work for a few years, I could see my office window from my apartment window. Going into the office wasn&#x27;t a big deal, it was just a 5 minute walk. I really didn&#x27;t care about going home for lunch because we had a cafeteria and I&#x27;d eat lunch or go get snack with my friends and there were probably 20 restaurants within a 10 minute walk so I had better options than a PB&J. It was much more of a social thing than a work thing, why sit in my apartment by myself when I have a half dozen people I enjoy hanging out with 5 minutes away. The only disadvantage was that due to my proximity I was always the go to person in case someone had to physically go to the office, the guy who lived 80 miles away was never asked to pop in on a Saturday to reboot something but I was asked all the time. reply karaterobot 18 hours agorootparentWhen I lived close to my office, I found the office became an extension of my home.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content The Verge homepage / Tech/ Reviews/ Science/ Entertainment/ More Menu GOOGLE/TECH/ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CNET is deleting old articles to try to improve its Google Search ranking / The tech news site has been ‘pruning’ older stories in an effort to show Google that its content is ‘fresh, relevant and worthy of being placed higher than our competitors in search results,’ according to an internal memo. By Mia Sato, platforms and communities reporter with five years of experience covering the companies that shape technology and the people who use their tools. Aug 9, 2023, 5:08 PM EDT|14 Comments / 14 New Share this story Image: Garret Beard / The Verge Technology news outlet CNET has deleted thousands of older articles from its site, telling staff the deletions will improve its Google Search ranking, according to an internal memo. The news was first reported by Gizmodo. Gizmodo reports that, since July, thousands of articles have been removed from CNET. In the memo, CNET says that so-called content pruning “sends a signal to Google that says CNET is fresh, relevant and worthy of being placed higher than our competitors in search results.” Stories slated to be “deprecated” are archived using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, and authors are alerted at least 10 days in advance, according to the memo. “Removing content from the site is not a decision we take lightly. Our teams analyze many data points to determine whether there are pages on CNET that are not currently serving a meaningful audience. These metrics include page views, backlink profiles and the amount of time that has passed since the last update,” the memo reads. A comparison between Wayback Machine archives from 2021 and CNET’s own on-site article counter shows that hundreds — and in some cases, thousands — of stories have disappeared from each year stretching back to the mid-1990s. Data for 2022 and 2023 wasn’t available. Red Ventures, a private equity-backed marketing firm that owns CNET, didn’t immediately respond to questions about the exact number of stories that have been removed. Red Ventures has applied a ruthless SEO strategy to its slate of outlets, which also includes The Points Guy, Healthline, and Bankrate. In January, Futurism reported that CNET had been quietly using artificial intelligence tools to produce articles — part of an expansive AI-driven SEO maneuver in which generative AI tools were used to create content that could carry affiliate ads. In the wake of that revelation and resulting errors on AI-generated stories, Red Ventures temporarily paused the content and overhauled its AI policy. CNET staff unionized in May, citing the need for more control over how generative AI tools are used and how the site monetizes its work. (Disclosure: The Verge’s editorial staff is also unionized with the Writers Guild of America, East.) Red Ventures and CNET justify the content pruning by pointing to Google Search’s ranking algorithm, saying the process will “improve SEO rankings and drive more meaningful user engagement.” As Gizmodo points out, removing a chunk of your archives is not inherently a good SEO strategy — Google has said its guidance doesn’t encourage the practice, though SEO experts told Gizmodo that it can be beneficial for sites if done carefully. Red Ventures appears to be undeterred. According to the memo, CNET will be subject to regular “content pruning” going forward, at least once a year. 14 COMMENTS14 NEW Most Popular Slack’s biggest redesign ever tries to tame the chaos of your workday MrBeast’s burger company is suing him for $100 million Verizon is shutting down the videoconferencing app it bought for $400 million YouTuber subjects the Galaxy Z Flip 5 to a week of continuous folding to see when it breaks Gizmodo editor-in-chief sues Apple over Tetris movie Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

So by removing low ranked old pages the avg position of their search results goes closer to the top even though total traffic sinks. I‘ve seen stuff like this happen at my own company as well, where a team‘s KPIs are designed such that they‘ll ruin absolute numbers in order to achieve their relative KPI goals, like getting an increase in conversion rates by just cutting all low-conversion traffic. reply basicoperation 3 hours agorootparentIn general, people often forget that if your target is a ratio, you can attack the numerator or the denominator. Often the latter is the easier to manipulate. reply iLoveOncall 9 minutes agorootparentEven if it&#x27;s not a ratio. When any metric becomes a target it will be gamed.My organization tracks how many tickets we have had open for 30 days or more. So my team started to close tickets after 30 days and let them reopen automatically. reply sn41 2 hours agorootparentprevBravo! In one sentence, you have captured the COVID statistics shenanigans of some countries. (roughly the strategy is: Go sample where you&#x27;re sure there are no patients - \"hey, we have this under control! look at the test positivity ratio!\" &#x2F;s) reply RheingoldRiver 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is why KPIs or targets should NEVER be calculated values like averages or ratios. The team is then incentivized to do something hostile such as not promote the content as much so that the ratio is higher, as soon as they barely scrape past the impressions mark. reply cedilla 2 hours agorootparentWhen deciding KPIs, Goodhart&#x27;s law should always be kept in mind: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.It&#x27;s really hard to not create perverse incentives with KPIs. Targets like \"% of tickets closed within 72 hours\" can wreck service quality if the team is under enough pressure or unscrupulous. reply iamacyborg 8 minutes agorootparentprevI mean, ideally you just have both an absolute and a calculated value to ensure both trend in the right direction. reply farnarkle 10 hours agorootparentprevThat only says that Google discourages such actions, not that such actions are not beneficial to SEO ranking (which is equal to the aforementioned economic incentive in this case). reply bagacrap 10 hours agorootparentSo whose word do we have to go on that this is beneficial, besides anonymous \"SEO experts\" and CNET leadership (those paragons of journalistic savvy)?Perhaps what CNET really means is that they&#x27;re deleting old low quality content with high bounce rates. After all, the best SEO is actually having the thing users want. reply SahAssar 9 hours agorootparentIn my experience SEO experts are the most superstitious tech people I ever met. One guy wanted me to reorder HTTP header fields to match another site. He wanted our minified HTML to include a linebreak just after a certain meta element just because some other site had it. I got requests to match variable names in minified JS just because googles own minified JS had that name. reply adrianmsmith 1 hour agorootparentOne SEO expert who consulted for a bank I worked at wanted us to change our URLs from e.g. &#x2F;products&#x2F;savings-accounts&#x2F;apply by reversing them to &#x2F;apply&#x2F;savings-accounts&#x2F;products on the grounds that the most specific thing about the page must be as close to the domain name as possible, according to them. I actually went ahead and changed our CMS to implement this (because I was told to). I&#x27;m sure the SEO expert got paid a lot more than I did as a dev. A sad day in my career. I left the company not long after... reply CharlesW 7 hours agorootparentprev> In my experience SEO experts are the most superstitious tech people I ever met.And some are the most data-driven people you&#x27;ll ever meet.

There comes a time when data analysis becomes astrology… reply andirk 4 hours agorootparent> There comes a time when data analysis becomes astrology.Excellent quote. It&#x27;s counterintuitive but looking at what is most likely to happen according to the datasets presented can often miss the bigger picture. reply reacharavindh 27 minutes agorootparentThis. It is often the scope and context that determines logic. It is easy to build bubbles and stay comfy inside. Without revealing much, I asked a data scientist whose job it is to figure out bids on keywords and essentially control how much $ is spent on advertising something at a specific region about negative criteria. As in, are you sure you wouldn’t get this benefit even if you stopped spending the $ and his response was “look at all this evidence that our spend caused this x% increase in traffic and y% more conversions” and that was 2 years ago. My follow up question was - okay, now that the thing you advertised is popular, wouldn’t it be the more organic choice in the market, and we can stop spending the $ there? His answer was - look at what happened when we stopped the advertising in this small region in Germany 1.5 years ago! My common sense validation question still stands. I still believe he built a shiny good bubble 2 years ago, and refuses to reason with wider context, and second degree effects. reply philsnow 51 minutes agorootparentprev> There comes a time when data analysis becomes astrology...or just plain numerology reply josefx 3 hours agorootparentprevMy data driven climate model indicates that we could combat climate change by hiring more pirates. reply brendank310 6 hours agorootparentprevI think you&#x27;re largely correct but Google isn&#x27;t one person so there may be somewhat emergent patterns that work from an SEO standpoint that don&#x27;t have a solid answer to Why. If I were an SEO customer I would ask for some proof but that isn&#x27;t the market they&#x27;re targeting.

I think I&#x27;d say the source is the original implementation pre-minification. I hate it too when working out how something is done on a site, but I&#x27;m wondering where we fall on that technicality. Is the output of a pre-processor still considered source code even if it&#x27;s not machine code? These are not important questions but now I&#x27;m wondering. reply gmerc 5 hours agorootparentand does an LLM care … it feels like minification doesn’t stop one form explaining the code at all. reply throwaway290 3 hours agorootparentprevSource code is what you write and read, but sometimes you write one thing and people can only read it after your pre processing. Why not enable pretty output?Plus I suspect minifying HTML or JS is often cargo cult (for small sites who are frying the wrong fish) or compensating for page bloat reply Dalewyn 7 hours agorootparentprevThe minified HTML (and, god forbid, JavaShit) is the source from which the browser ultimately renders a page, so yes that is source code. reply naniwaduni 7 hours agorootparent\"The ISA bytecode is the source from which the processor ultimately executes a program, so yes that is source code.\" reply hunter2_ 6 hours agorootparentI suppose the difference is that someone debugging at that level will be offered some sort of \"dump\" command or similar, whereas someone debugging in a browser is offered a \"View Source\" command. It&#x27;s just a matter of convention and expectation.If we wanted browsers to be fed code that for performance reasons isn&#x27;t human-readable, web servers ought to serve something that&#x27;s processed way more than just gzipped minification. It could be more like bytecode. reply phatskat 4 hours agorootparent> It could be more like bytecode.Isn’t this essential what WebAssembly is doing? I’ll admit I haven’t looked into it much, as I’m crap with C&#x2F;++, though I’d like to try Rust. Having “near native” performance in a browser sounds nice, curious to see how far it’s come. reply panzi 5 hours agorootparentprevIf you need to use prettiefy to even have a chance to understand the code, is it still source code?About the byte code: You mean wasm? (Guess that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re alluding to.) reply Dalewyn 4 hours agorootparentprev>If we wanted browsers to be fed code that for performance reasons isn&#x27;t human-readable,Worth keeping in mind that \"performance\" here refers to saving bandwidth costs as the host. Every single unnecessary whitespace or character is a byte that didn&#x27;t need to be uploaded, hence minify and save on that bandwidth and thus $$$$.The performance difference on the browser end between original and minified source code is negligible. reply hnlmorg 3 hours agorootparentLast time I ran the numbers (which admittedly was quite a number of years ago now), the difference between minified and unminified code was negligible once you factored in compression because unminified code compresses better.What really adds to the source code footprint is all of those trackers, adverts and, in a lot of cases, framework overhead. reply hunter2_ 3 hours agorootparentprevI was thinking transfer speed, although even then, the difference is probably negligible if compressing regardless. reply Dalewyn 3 hours agorootparentThe way I see it, if someone needs to minify their JavaShit (and HTML?! CSS?!) to improve user download times, that download time was horseshit to start with and they need to rebuild everything properly from the ground up. reply regular_trash 6 hours agorootparentprevTurrles all the way down reply vasco 5 hours agorootparentprevNobody tell this guy about compilers. reply midoridensha 4 hours agorootparentprevSo I guess you think compiled code is even worse, right? reply Dalewyn 4 hours agorootparentI mean, isn&#x27;t that precisely why open source advocates advocate for open source?Not to mention, there is no need to \"minify\" HTML, CSS, or JavaShit for a browser to render a page unlike compiled code which is more or less a necessity for such things. reply hunter2_ 3 hours agorootparentIf someone releases only a minified version of their code, and licenses it as free as can be, is it open source? reply midoridensha 2 hours agorootparentprevMinifying code for browsers greatly reduces the amount of bandwidth needed to serve web traffic. There&#x27;s a good reason it&#x27;s done.By your logic, there&#x27;s actually no reason to use compiled code at all, for almost anything above the kernel. We can just use Python to do everything, including run browsers, play video games, etc. Sure, it&#x27;ll be dog-slow, but you seem to care more about reading the code than performance or any other consideration. reply Dalewyn 1 hour agorootparentI already alluded[1] to the incentives for the host to minify their JavaShit, et al., and you would have a point if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that performance otherwise isn&#x27;t significantly different between minified and full source code as far as the user would be concerned.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37072473 reply midoridensha 57 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m not talking about the browser&#x27;s performance, I&#x27;m talking about the network bandwidth. All that extra JS code in every HTTP GET adds up. For a large site serving countless users, it adds up to a lot of bandwidth. replyhenriquez 7 hours agorootparentprevIt’s also a crime against zorgons from Planet Zomblaki. reply makeitdouble 4 hours agorootparentprevWhile CNET might not be the most reliable side, Google telling content owners to not play SEO games is also too biased to be taken at face value.It reminds me of Apple&#x27;s \"don&#x27;t run to the press\" advice when hitting bugs or app review issues. While we&#x27;d assume Apple knows best, going against their advice totally works and is by far the most efficient action for anyone with enough reach. reply agrajag 9 hours agorootparentprevGoogle actually describes an entirely plausible mechanism of action here at [1]. old content slows down site crawling, which can cause new content to not be refreshed as often.Sure, one page doesn’t matter, but thousands will.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;searchliaison&#x2F;status&#x2F;1689068723657904129... reply magicalist 9 hours agorootparentIt says it doesn&#x27;t affect ranking and their quote tweet is even more explicithttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;searchliaison&#x2F;status&#x2F;1689297947740295168 reply fshbbdssbbgdd 8 hours agorootparentThis is the actual quote from Google PR:>Removing it might mean if you have a massive site that we’re better able to crawl other content on the site. But it doesn’t mean we go “oh, now the whole site is so much better” because of what happens with an individual page.Parsing this carefully, to me it sounds worded to give the impression removing old pages won’t help the ranking of other pages without explicitly saying so. In other words, if it turns out that deleting old pages helps your ranking (indirectly, by making Google crawl your new pages faster), this tweet is truthful on a technicality.In the context of negative attention where some of the blame for old content being removed is directed toward Google, there is a clear motive for a PR strategy that deflects in this way. reply hedora 7 hours agorootparentThe tweet is also clearly saying that deleting old content will increase the average page rank of your articles in the first N hours after it is published. (Because the time to first crawl will decrease, and the page rank is effectively zero before the first crawl).CNet is big enough that I’d expect Google to ensure the crawler has fresh news articles from it, but that isn’t explicitly said anywhere. reply Twisell 3 hours agorootparentAnd considering all the AI hype, one could have hoped that the leading search engine crawler would be able to \"smartly\" detect new contents based on a url containing a timestamp.Apparently not if this SEO trick is really a thing...EDIT : sorry my bad it&#x27;s actually the opposite. One could expect that a site like CNET would include a timestamp and a unique ID in their URL in 2023. This seems to be the \"unpermalink\" of a recent cnet article.Maybe the SEO expert could have started there...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-rev... reply zpeti 3 hours agorootparentprevDude, like who is google? The judicial system of the web?No. Google has their own motivations here, they are a player not a rule maker.Don’t trust SEOs as no one actually knows what works, but certainly dont think google is telling you the absolute truth. reply samplatt 5 hours agorootparentprevConsidering how much paid-for unimportant and unrelated drivel I now have to wade through every time I google to get what I am asking for, I doubt very much that whatever is optimal for search-engine ranking has anything to do with what users want. reply water-your-self 8 hours agorootparentprevWrong, the best SEO is having what users want and withholding it long enough to get a high average session time. reply bmer 5 hours agorootparentAnd I suppose a corollary is: \"claim to have what the users want, and have them spend long enough to figure out that you don&#x27;t have it\"? reply dawnerd 2 hours agorootparentprevSee: every recipe site in existence. reply meragrin_ 9 hours agorootparentprev> That only says that Google discourages such actionsNope. It says that Google does not ding you for old content.\"Are you deleting content from your site because you somehow believe Google doesn&#x27;t like \"old\" content? That&#x27;s not a thing!\" reply legutierr 7 hours agorootparentDo the engineers at Google even know how the Google algorithm actually works? Better than SEO experts who spend there time meticulously tracking the way that the algorithm behaves under different circumstances?My bet is that they don&#x27;t. My bet is that there is so much old code, weird data edge cases and opaque machine-learning models driving the search results, Google&#x27;s engineers have lost the ability to predict what the search results would be or should be in the majority of cases.SEO experts might not have insider knowledge, but they observe in detail how the algorithm behaves, in a wide variety of circumstances, over extended periods of time. And if they say that deleting old content improves search ranking, I&#x27;m inclined to believe them over Google.Maybe the people at Google can tell us what they want their system to do. But does it do what they want it to do anymore?

How would a company die with $279.8B revenue, steadily increasing yearly? reply chongli 9 hours agorootparentI think the theory of Google&#x27;s death is that they are \"killing the golden goose.\" The idea is that they are killing off all the independent websites on the internet. That is, all the sites besides Facebook&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;NetFlix&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;etc. that people access directly (either through an app or a bookmark) and which (barring Reddit) block GoogleBot anyway.These are all the sites (like CNET) that Google indexes which are the entire reason to use search. They are having their rankings steadily eroded by an ever-rising tide of SEO spam. If they start dying off en masse and if LLMs emerge as a viable alternative for looking up information, we may see Google Search die along with them.As for why their revenues are still increasing? It&#x27;s because all the SEO spam sites out there run Google Ads. This is how we close the loop on the \"killing the golden goose\" theory. Google uses legitimate sites to make their search engine a viable product and at the same time directs traffic away from those legitimate sites towards SEO spam to generate revenue. It&#x27;s a transformation from symbiosis&#x2F;mutualism to parasitism.Edit: I forgot to mention the last, and darkest, part of the theory. Many of these SEO spam sites engage in large-scale piracy by scraping all their content off legitimate sites. By allowing their ads to run on these sites, Google is essentially acting as an accessory to large-scale, criminal, commercial copyright infringement. reply Denzel 7 hours agorootparent> Google uses legitimate sites to make their search engine a viable product and at the same time directs traffic away from those legitimate sites towards SEO spam to generate revenue.[Disclosure: Google Search SWE; opinions and thoughts are my own and do not represent those of my employer]Why do you assume malicious intent?The balance between search ranking (Google) and search optimization (third-party sites) is an adversarial, dynamic game played between two sides with inverse incentives, taking place on an economic field (i.e. limited resources). There is no perfect solution; there’s only an evolutionary act-react cycle.Do you think content spammers spend more or less resources (people, time, money) than Google’s revenue? So then the problem becomes how do you win a battle with orders of magnitude less people, time, and money? Leverage, i.e., engineering. You try your best and watch the scoreboard.Some people think Google is doing a great job; some think we couldn’t be any worse. The truth probably lies across a spectrum in the middle. So it goes with a globally consumed product.Also, note, Ads and Search operate completely independent.

SEO spam has more ads, thus generates more income for Google. Even if Ads and Search operate \"completely independently\", there must be a person in the corporate hierarchy which has control over both and could push the products to better synergize and make that KPI tick up.Actually deranking sites which feature more than three Google Ads banners would improve search quality (mainly by making sites get to the point rather than padding a simple answer into an essay like an 8th grader at an exam) - but it would reduce Ads income so you cannot do it, no matter how independent you claim to be. reply chongli 7 hours agorootparentprevAlso, note, Ads and Search operate completely independentThat’s the mistake.

The Tools button isn&#x27;t prominent, the current value of the time range option is completely hidden when it&#x27;s on the default of \"Any time\", and the search query doesn&#x27;t change if you alter the time range option.

Visit an old article and look at the related articles, most read, read this next, etc widgets around the page. They’ll be showing current content, which changes frequently even if the old article text itself does not. reply linkjuice4all 9 hours agorootparentprevIt’s possible they examined the server logs for requests from GoogleBot and found it wasting time on old content (this was not mentioned in the article but would be a very telling data point beyond just “engagement metrics”).There’s some methodology to trying to direct Google crawls to certain sections of the site first - but typically Google already has a lot of your URLs indexed and it’s just refreshing from that list. reply codedokode 10 hours agorootparentprevTo determine whether content changes Google has to spend budget as well, hasn&#x27;t it?

Sci-fi novels describe this hypothetical market structure as a \"competitive market\".In this utopic arrangement, users of search services are more-or-less evenly distributed among different search providers, enjoying a variety of different takes on how to find stuff.Search providers, continues the sci-fi imagination, keep innovating and differentiating themselves to keep an edge over competition and please their users.Producers of content, one the other hand, cannot assume much about what the inventive and aggressively competitive group of search providers will accentuate to please their users. So they focus on... improving the quality of their content, which is what they do best anyway.Its a win-win for users and content producers.

Several years ago, Google had announced that page load speed will affect the ranking. Google&#x27;s tool, PageSpeed Insights gave recommendations on improving load speed. But it also recommended to lower quality of JPEG images to the level where artifacts would be visible. So instead of proper manual testing (using eyes, not a mathematical formula) on a large set of images, some Google employee simply wrote a recommended compression level out of their head and this forced web masters to worsen the quality of the images below any acceptable level.So it doesn&#x27;t matter if the photographer or illustrator worked hard to make a beautiful image, Google&#x27;s robotic decision based on some lifeless mathematical formula crossed out their efforts. reply CamperBob2 10 hours agoparentThat also explains why 2000s-era postage-stamp size photos are now back in vogue.When it comes to Google, sufficiently-advanced malice is indistinguishable from incompetence. reply petee 11 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve seen a couple news sources that are altering their publish dates to show near the top of news feeds.

And search engines too adapt and change their algorithms to best serve advertisers.As a result it becomes ever harder and harder for users to actually find the information they want in a format that works.It&#x27;s become so bad, that it&#x27;s now more practicable to use advanced AI to filter out the actual information and re-format it, rather than go look for for it yourself.As a human, you no longer want to use the web, and search... you want to have a bot that does that for you... because ultimately the space has become pretty hostile to humans. reply llarsson 1 hour agoprevThe fact that they resorted to writing crap these days with AI is what is making them lose relevance, not that they have been in the business for a long time, and have thousands upon thousands of articles.CNET used to, perhaps not be cool, but it certainly was a place you&#x27;d go get tech news from every once in a while.

    "originBody": "Not using Mullvad VPN San Francisco, United States Check for leaks About Policies Blog Pricing Servers Downloads Help Account Get started Infrastructure audit completed by Radically Open Security 9 August 2023 EXTERNAL AUDITS We tasked the Netherlands based security firm Radically Open Security (RoS) with performing the third audit towards our VPN infrastructure. We asked them to focus solely on VPN servers that run from RAM, one OpenVPN and one WireGuard server. We invite you to read the final report of our third security audit, concluded in mid-June 2023, with many fixes deployed late June 2023. Further re-tests and a verification pass was performed during July. RoS discovered a number of new findings, and we would like to thank them for their thorough and detailed report. They stated , amongst other things that: that whilst they found some issues, that: “The Mullvad VPN relays which were the subject of this test showed a mature architecture…” and “During the test we found no logging of user activity data..” We gave RoS full SSH access to two (2) VPN servers that were running from RAM, using our latest slimmed down Linux kernel (6.3.2) and customised Ubuntu 22.04 LTS based OS. These servers were deployed as though they were to be production customer-facing servers, however these servers have never been utilised as such. We asked them to verify: Security and set up of servers internally Security and set up of servers externally Whether or not we log customer activity RoS also asked whether they should investigate the source code of various binaries running on our systems, or whether they should take into consideration the hardware-level security. We declined both offers, stating that this is to be considered an “after the system is running and in-use by customers” audit. Overview of findings Radically Open Security found no information leakage or logging of customer data RoS discovered 1 High, 6 Elevated, 4 Moderate, 10 Low and 4 info-severity issues during this penetration test. Key takeaway: Our VPN infrastructure has been audited for the third time. Miscellaneous issues of interest MLL-024 Production multihop traffic on test system (High) To quote RoS: “Impact - Production user traffic is visible to pentest users.” Our comments: RoS were given production-like servers, provisioned and deployed like all other customer facing servers. The difference between these and the rest of our fleet is that they have never been made available for customers to connect, they were not advertised in our server list, and not offered up to users. However, as these servers are connected to our WireGuard multihop functionality, any customer scanning for IPs can send traffic though them whilst connected to another VPN server using a SOCKS5 proxy, as there is nothing blocking it. In what RoS discovered there was only the IP from the WireGuard internal interface. This interface is only available to SOCKS5 multihop traffic, so it would be the entry WireGuard server. Without providing RoS with production servers the audit would not have been valid as a production server audit, and there would have been no way to prevent customer traffic from being visible on the servers. MLL-019 - LPE to root using systemd timers and insecure directory permissions (Elevated) To quote RoS: “Low-privileged system accounts can elevate their privileges to root by manipulating systemd timer script content.” Our comments: It became obvious after consulting with RoS that the primary issue here is the use of nested home directories, and the addition of administrator users being part of the mad group. The usage of the nested /home/mad directory structure is a legacy remnant of pre-RAM VPN servers, which is going to be removed in the upcoming updates to our infrastructure. In the short-term we have removed all administrator users from being part of the mad group, but we have also moved all related scripts to /opt/local_checks which RoS acknowledged as resolving the issue. MLL-045 — Administrator access to production machines (Moderate) To quote RoS: “VPN servers accept remote logins from administrators, who technically have the ability to tap into production users' VPN traffic” Our comments: We have been aware of this issue for some time, and conversing with RoS only confirmed our plans to implement such measures: Implement a method by which unauthorised logins can be auditable, and add a log of all the commands (without arguments) used on these servers. We are implementing such a system. Remove support for SSH entirely, this would mean that even administrators could not enable logging of customer traffic, since no access is enabled over SSH. We are investigating such a system, though this will take more time to perform correctly. MLL-016 - Telegraf password shared across servers (low) To quote RoS: “Shared Influx database credentials used by Telegraf across VPN servers allows manipulation of global server metrics, such as CPU and disk usage or network metrics.” Our comments: We deemed the best course of action here to implement client certificates for authentication using the PKI infrastructure available within Hashicorp Vault. This has now been implemented, and we will investigate the use of such certificates in other places across our infrastructure. --- There are more changes to be deployed in the near future, and the listed fixes are examples of the most interesting issues that Radically Open Security found.

I first saw it when they disabled auto-renewal with PayPal, because it&#x27;d force them to store PII along with your account.Unfortunately for me, they made one too many sacrifices, and disabled port forwarding[1]. They don&#x27;t store any contact information that could be used to warn customers, so my connection mysteriously failed one day and I was left with several months of prepaid service.I&#x27;m a bit bitter for that, but honestly their technical writing and security decisions have earned enough good will from me that I want them to keep the money. As the only VPN that doesn&#x27;t feel shady, I wish them all the best.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;5&#x2F;29&#x2F;removing-the-support-f... reply kfreds 19 hours agoparentI sincerely apologize for the inconvenience we have caused you.Announcing the removal of a feature such as this a mere 30 days ahead is not how we like to conduct our business in the general case. I expect those of our customers who relied on this feature to be disappointed by its removal as well as the manner in which it was done.Nevertheless it was the right thing to do. The manner and extent in which it came to be abused in recent months made it unacceptable for us to continue providing it. This feature should have been removed a long time ago, with a longer grace period. It wasn&#x27;t - a mistake on our part - and some of our users suffered for it, including you. For this I am sorry.Affected customers can get their money back for any prepaid service they can not use, of course.If you used port forwarding to (I) make a service reachable (II) from the open Internet there are plenty of good hosting providers which will happily take your business.If you used port forwarding to (III) stay anonymous while (I) making a service reachable we can highly recommend Tor&#x27;s \"onion service\" feature. It was built with that use case in mind.If you used port forwarding to (III) stay anonymous while (I) making a service reachable (II) from the open Internet, there are no good options that we can recommend.Port forwarding needed to be removed on moral grounds. It needed to be removed because it was causing too much of a disturbance to our core mission of making mass surveillance and censorship ineffective.I hope my explanation has - if not allayed your disappointment - at least provided some clarity.Best regards, Fredrik Stromberg (cofounder of Mullvad VPN) reply BoppreH 19 hours agorootparentThanks for the reply. I&#x27;m sorry my negative comment got to first spot on what should have been a positive post. I understand why the decision was made, and I think I&#x27;d have done the same.I really hope you guys stick around, Mullvad has exactly the posture that we need from security services. reply kfreds 18 hours agorootparentThank you. There is no need to be sorry. I&#x27;m grateful for the opportunity to clarify things. reply madars 19 hours agorootparentprevPort forwarding doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem for long-established independent VPNs like AirVPN (based in Italy but very ingeniously without exit servers in Italy) or AzireVPN (Swedish; added port forwarding -- all mappings in memory, no static records -- just recently [1]). What makes Mullvad&#x27;s situation different? Is it a question of margins for high traffic port forwarding users (Mullvad is branching out in browsers and search while these two are not) or something else? I used to be a long time user and a huge fan and proponent of Mullvad&#x27;s but the communication here has been very much opaque. This is especially so as port forwarding removal was announced straight after a raid where police, after Mullvad&#x27;s explanations, didn&#x27;t take anything [2].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.azirevpn.com&#x2F;port-forwarding&#x2F; [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;4&#x2F;20&#x2F;mullvad-vpn-was-subjec... reply kfreds 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sorry we haven&#x27;t been more clear in our communication.Our decision to remove port forwarding was not a question of margins - it was a moral and practical decision.Port forwarding is a feature with many legitimate use cases. This year it became clear that we had become popular for use cases we didn&#x27;t want to support. Undesirable content and malicious services is a good summary. I&#x27;m not privy to more details than that as my main focus is research.Technology is often a double-edged sword, but thankfully it is often also a net benefit to its users and society in general. Privacy online is exactly that kind of technology. Enabling anyone to host any service anonymously on the open Internet is another matter.I hope AirVPN and AzireVPN somehow succeed with providing that feature while steering clear of its downsides. That would be awesome.Nitpick: Mullvad is older than both Air and Azire. :) reply madars 15 hours agorootparentThank you! That clarifies :) I&#x27;m also glad for all the innovations Mullvad has invented&#x2F;supported&#x2F;etc in the VPN space -- anonymous account numbers, multi-server SOCKS proxies, Wireguard over TCP, post-quantum Wireguard, stboot, open APIs, the list goes on.It feels like VPN for apps is very different than a VPN for browsing. While in both cases I want my traffic to be mixed in with a lot of other people&#x27;s traffic (so service provider dealing with complaints about neighbors is part of the value proposition), browsing use case is tied to IP reputation (so don&#x27;t want someone to run a Tor exit on the same IP), whereas the app use case is much less IP reputation-sensitive but definitely benefits from port forwarding (e.g. to anonymously run nodes that powers distributed infrastructure like crypto).I&#x27;d definitely pay premium, with longer commitments up front for \"this server might be useless for browsing but run all your anonymous crypto nodes behind forwarded ports\" type of service. Maybe if port forwarding is active only if you have 6+ months of outstanding service commitment (and you forfeit the balance if your port gets used for C&C or whatnot) is enough of a deterrent. Some VPNs are doing some traffic segregation already, e.g. having dedicated servers for P2P, though nothing exactly like this. reply capableweb 18 hours agorootparentprevIt seems pretty evident why they had to turn it off:> The manner and extent in which it came to be abused in recent months made it unacceptable for us to continue providing it.Probably the difference between Mullvad and AirVPN&#x2F;AzireVPN is how popular the service is, which also usually dictates how popular it is for people to try to abuse it.Maybe 1% of each service&#x27;s traffic is abuse, which for AirVPN&#x2F;AzireVPN is not that much, but on Mullvads scale it becomes a whole nother beast. reply Victor1024 15 hours agorootparentprevMullvad is probably the VPN with the longest track record of not keeping logs. I find it likely that the vast majority of people who hosted immoral content using Mullvad&#x27;s port forwarding feature solely used Mullvad for this purpose because of their reputation. After Mullvad discontinued port forwarding, IVPN (probably the second most trusted VPN provider) came out a month later and announced that they were also discontinuing port forwarding [1]. I think it is likely other VPN providers will follow suit.According to Mullvads blog [2] the police raid was related to a blackmail attack in Germany.[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ivpn.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gradual-removal-of-port-forwarding[2]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;5&#x2F;2&#x2F;update-the-swedish-auth... reply codedokode 10 hours agorootparentSo basically no companies wish to provide anonymous unrestricted uncensored information exchange. reply treesciencebot 19 hours agorootparentprevWhat sort of abuses you have encountered when dealing with port forwarding? Was it DMCA&#x27;d content hosting or were there other major issues with it? Also how does other VPNs that offer port forwarding (like Proton) function against those sort of abuses? reply electroly 18 hours agorootparentVPN port forwarding is, by and large, used for BitTorrent because you can&#x27;t seed without it. VPNs are used for BitTorrent in general because it&#x27;s well-known that IPs participating in BitTorrent are monitored and logged by anyone who wants to[0]. I bet it&#x27;s at least 100 BitTorrent users for every 1 user using port forwarding for any other purpose.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iknowwhatyoudownload.com&#x2F; reply Arcuru 17 hours agorootparentYou can still seed&#x2F;download without port forwarding setup, however the other person you&#x27;re connected to needs to have port forwarding. Basically either side of the P2P connection needs to be reachable from the open internet, but not both.So you can still seed, it just won&#x27;t be as usable. reply alwyn 19 hours agorootparentprevThey give some examples of things bad actors used port forwarding for in the blog post[1] announcing the removal of the feature.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;5&#x2F;29&#x2F;removing-the-support-f... reply azalemeth 19 hours agorootparentReading between the lines, I&#x27;d be very surprised if it wasn&#x27;t highly undesirable content, i.e. child porn or fraud. This came about a month after a very publicised raid by the Swedish police -- after which they left with nothing [1].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;mullvad-vpn-hit-with-search-warra... reply kfreds 18 hours agorootparentFYI: Our decision to remove port forwarding was not a reaction to the surprise visit by Swedish police. I wish we had been more clear about this in our blog post. reply vGPU 8 hours agorootparentprevI am highly certain it involved both and more.For example, say someone wanted to run their botnet distribution server. Now, unless you’re a state actor working for North Korea or some such, that generally gets a rather angry knock on your door in a rather short period of time.Being able to hide your IP&#x2F;traffic for $5&#x2F;mo is going to save you a significant amount of trouble.I’m certain AWS and other hosting providers keep track of any activity that’s too strange, and the authorities will have your hosting provider give you the boot even if they can’t figure out who you are exactly.Developing a reputation for allowing, if not quite condoning such behavior will quite quickly get you shut down as a business. Even if they can’t “prove” anything, you’ll get hassled, harassed, and investigated to death because your existence goes from being a nuisance to being a problem.Some guy torrented a few movies on your VPN? Whatever. Some guy used your VPN to break into their local government’s servers? If they can’t find him, they’ll take it out on you. reply kfreds 18 hours agorootparentprevThere were several major issues. reply wing-_-nuts 19 hours agorootparentprevI had no idea this even happened. It would have been useful to show a notice within the app itself (like you do for patch notes?). Maybe you did, and I didn&#x27;t see it, but I just got done paying for another 6mo on your service being none the wiser. reply kfreds 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure whether we did or not. Please don&#x27;t hesitate to contact support for a refund of remaining time in case you&#x27;ve decided to switch providers. reply nerdchum 18 hours agorootparentprevThis is a very articulately worded and elegant response. reply 93po 17 hours agorootparentprevIt is wild how good of a company and team you’ve proven to be. The world would be a much better place if everyone operated this way reply hunter2_ 20 hours agoparentprev> They don&#x27;t store any contact information that could be used to warn customers, so my connection mysteriously failed one dayThis situation seems avoidable: what if the payment&#x2F;signup flow had a big loud warning that you need to configure your own polling of an RSS endpoint using a client capable of pinging you? reply noahjk 20 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s honestly a great idea for an alternative to newsletters... it would be nice if there was better first-party RSS support (what about in the email client?) since I don&#x27;t think any OSs have it, because right now that would probably confuse most customers reply headsman771 20 hours agorootparentThe likelihood of being confused by rss among mullvad customers can&#x27;t be very high. reply chefandy 17 hours agorootparentYou might be surprised! The Mullvad client is super well designed and usable for newbs, and I&#x27;ll bet a lot of their business is from people whose more technical friends told them it was a good idea. There&#x27;s a reason that Tor warns users that posting personal information or using accounts with their regular credentials compromises anonymity.I wish RSS had more surface area with general computer users, but I reckon even being called RSS makes it unlikely. Folks in tech often forget how intimidating opaque names can be for nontechnical users. reply hunter2_ 6 hours agorootparentNot being a Mullvad user myself, I wasn&#x27;t sure if people tend to use a Mullvad client or a generic VPN stack built into their OS, but the Mullvad client could simply display news like this to the former set of users leaving only the latter set to configure a separate RSS client or whatever. reply samcat116 13 hours agorootparentprevThis might be the most HN comment I’ve seen in a while reply pixelatedindex 20 hours agoparentprevI’m a network newbie so I have no idea about the importance of this. I have done port forwarding in my router before, mainly so I can access my Plex system outside of my house. I used to setup port forwarding when torrenting but I have realized that I can still get my Linux ISOs without it. I never cared even though I’m a heavy user of their product. When will it start to affect me, or in other words, what use cases am I locked out of when port forwarding is disabled? reply duozerk 20 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;d need that feature if you desired to host an actual service (a webserver for example) behind the VPN reply pixelatedindex 18 hours agorootparentOh!! That makes a ton of sense now, I feel dumb for not thinking about that since I was just doing some config changes for Docker services running in my home server. I realized I couldn’t access it from another machine because the Dockerfile didn’t have ports forwarded appropriately. Thank you very much! reply treyd 16 hours agorootparentprevYour torrent client probably uses UPnP to have your router selectively open ports to your machine for the duration of the session. reply riley_dog 19 hours agoparentprevAfter they disabled port forwarding, I moved to ProtonVPN. They seem like the next best thing, and they continue to state that they have no intention of removing port forwarding (for now, I assume). reply pteraspidomorph 21 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m glad to read this. We considered switching to them earlier this year (couldn&#x27;t find the budget) and it was still on the table, but this is a deal breaker. If we&#x27;d switched I&#x27;d have been in the same situation, with a lot of prepaid service I couldn&#x27;t use as intended. reply BoppreH 21 hours agorootparentTo be fair, the announcement came with the option of asking for refunds, and I have no reason to doubt them. My few interactions with their support were pretty good. reply pipes 12 hours agoparentprevBecoming well known for always trying to put customers first is a good strategy and probably makes business sense in the long run. I have used mullvad for years. I have no intention of shifting provider. Mainly because the evidence is starting to stack up that they are one of the few good actors in a cess pit of shitty&#x2F;shady competition. (Though it&#x27;s a shane mullvad gets blocked by netflix, well the last time I tried it wasn&#x27;t working).The only other service I have any brand loyalty to gog.com. For some reason I feel the same about them. reply iaresee 21 hours agoparentprevHave you found a replacement? I did some light investigation but nothing really felt as solid as Mullvad so I haven&#x27;t jumped ship yet. reply BoppreH 20 hours agorootparentNone as solid, no. My needs are fairly specific (exit node in a specific country, torrent-friendly, good speed, not too expensive, not too shady, first-party support for my OS&#x27;es, doesn&#x27;t have to be government-proof), so you&#x27;ll need to do your own research.For what&#x27;s worth, I eventually went with Proton VPN, but it&#x27;s more expensive and gives a used-car-salesman feeling. reply digging 19 hours agorootparent> gives a used-car-salesman feeling.I really don&#x27;t like the aesthetic direction Proton&#x27;s been taking in the last few years, from top to bottom. I&#x27;m finding their mail apps, both in desktop web browser and on mobile, less and less usable. In addition I get this feeling from their design choices as well. I know their mission is to grow enough to challenge predatory providers like gmail, but it makes me wary and makes me feel as if I won&#x27;t be using them in 5 more years. reply xvector 18 hours agorootparentProton has unfortunately become incredibly bloated over the past few years. Meanwhile ProtonMail doesn&#x27;t yet support auto-forwarding or (on mobile) email content search. reply irusensei 20 hours agorootparentprevNot that person but I&#x27;ve spinned a 1984 instance paid with bitcoin without KYC. Then setup nat+rdr rules that foward to my service through a wireguard tunnel. reply codedokode 10 hours agorootparentWhy use wireguard? It is trivially to detect by the ISP or government. Every decent VPN should masquerade as HTTP&#x2F;2 or HTTP&#x2F;3. reply mandelken 16 hours agorootparentprevForgive my ignorance, but what’s a “1984 instance”? (Google could not help me.) Thanks! reply skulk 16 hours agorootparentI googled \"1984 vps\" and came up with http:&#x2F;&#x2F;1984.hosting&#x2F;. I have no idea if this is what GP is referring to. reply iaresee 19 hours agorootparentprevThis might be the way I go. Thanks. reply jjice 20 hours agoparentprevI use IVPN and they also deprecated port forwarding. I believe they didn&#x27;t cut people off directly but if you stop using it you can restart using it. I wonder if they removed it for the same reason. reply darkwater 15 hours agoparentprevWhat are legitimate use case to use port-forwarding behind a VPN IP? Genuinely curious, I&#x27;m not implying anything. The main use-case is hosting something for which you don&#x27;t want to reveal your IP or circumvent some ISP that block hosting web servers on their residential IPs. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing many more use cases. reply rand846633 2 hours agorootparentCan be used for hosting libgen&#x2F;sci-hub.Basically you have a thin proxy on some not so cheap but ‘anonymous’ Bitcoin payed VM, that then (http) links to your vpn endpoint.You need the dual setup as using the btc vm for storage of terabytes of data as well as for TB of traffic is too expensive for a volunteer run project. reply morpheuskafka 15 hours agorootparentprevI have been out of the loop for a while on this, but doesn&#x27;t BitTorrent require you to set up a port forward? Otherwise you can only connect to peers that do, but not other peers that don&#x27;t. reply codedokode 10 hours agorootparentI think it is possible to connect using STUN even if both users are behind NAT. reply asynchronous 21 hours agoparentprevThey still support opening up ports, it’s just randomized instead of dedicated like uPnP. reply internet-mat 21 hours agorootparentThis isn’t true, Mullvad completely disabled port forwarding earlier this year. See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;5&#x2F;29&#x2F;removing-the-support-f... reply asynchronous 21 hours agorootparentI’m confused, the blog post backs up what you say but I can still set custom ports within my account page… And I’m currently running a service that needs to advertise out on a port to work from Mullvad. reply fruitreunion1 21 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t want to revoke a key to test but I&#x27;m pretty sure that just sets the port in the Endpoint part of the WireGuard config file. (the port you use to connect, for if the regular one is blocked). Are you sure your service behind Mullvad is accepting incoming connections? reply piaste 20 hours agorootparentprevIs it a torrent client, by any chance? Those can still work without port forwarding, if the swarm member you&#x27;re sharing data with (regardless of direction) has an open port on their side.Try creating a new torrent with some random file, seeding it from a Mullvad device and downloading it from a different Mullvad device. That should only work if you have port forwarding set up (or if you&#x27;re not actually going through Mullvad - you will see that by the peer IP in the torrent client). reply electroly 20 hours agorootparentprevThat custom port on the WireGuard config page is not the place where you&#x27;d configure port forwarding; that&#x27;s not what that is. They had a separate port forwarding page for configuring city ports which is now gone. But you say you have it working. My guess is that you&#x27;re just misremembering where the configuration is, and that Mullvad hasn&#x27;t removed existing port forwards yet like they said they would. reply nabogh 21 hours agorootparentprevOh really? Could you elaborate or point me in the direction of more information on this please? reply asynchronous 21 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;account&#x2F;wireguard-configIn the wireguard config section of their tutorials, there’s a spot to put a custom port - it’s really unclear from the docs but this allows you to expose out a service within the higher limits of the port ranges, and only on dedicated servers.Really hard to find but they call this “city ports” over global ports because you have to set them up beforehand. reply Hakkin 20 hours agorootparentThe \"custom port\" option in the config creator just sets the endpoint port to use for Wireguard. It has nothing to do with port forwarding. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 20 hours agoparentprevThe discontinuation of port forwarding forced me to leave which is unfortunate because they are excellent. reply dijit 23 hours agoprevMy biggest professional regret is not joining Mullvad when their founder emailed me.A seriously large chunk of their values aligns with my own, and it&#x27;s woefully few technical enthusiasts that continue to place liberty over convenience -- meaning most of us tend to use hyperscaler cloud providers under the purview of the US Government. -- and before anyone mentions it; yes that has been an issue for me in my professional career as the cloud providers must adhere to US sanctions, meaning if you are from Cuba, Iran or Crimea you can&#x27;t play the games I made. -- which is annoying because you could buy our game legally in Russia and Ukraine, but if you happened to be in occupied territory then no play time for you.Sidetracked a bit, but it&#x27;s really refreshing from the outside to see a company that isn&#x27;t scummy that values liberty. reply PentiumBug 21 hours agoparentYup. As a Cuban, sometimes it is annoying and sometimes go beyond that. Some cloud providers are totally off limits for us, some are fine with us (the minority and less known), some let us use some services but no others, some even have valid OFAC licenses but still deny access (because ACL complexities, I suppose)... it&#x27;s all over the place. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m 95% of the time on crappy VPNs both to escape&#x2F;evade US sanctions and my own country censoring mechanisms.The thing is, I somewhat understand why the sanctions were placed decades ago, but... is that rationale still valid? Anyway, and sadly, the sanctions affect \"regular\" people like me the most. The ruling elite? Not at all.Thank you for your position, BTW! reply barrotes 20 hours agorootparentFunny how everyone talks about the Chinese \"great firewall\" that blocks access towards some western platforms from China, and no one talks about \"USA great firewall\" that blocks Cuban citizen from acceding to a lot of services reply NikolaNovak 19 hours agorootparentBesides the technical differences brought up by other commenters, I&#x27;m a Canadian and I hear about USA sanctions toward Cuba on regular TV news and newspapers, never mind more specific news sources, every USA election cycle. It&#x27;s a massive topic of public debate, and from what I can see it hugely influences outcomes of key seats in state and federal elections.

And even if it were true, one might keep in mind that the reasons for that might not be obvious. E.g. there had been a fair amount of anti-Ukrainian propaganda on the Russian state TV (which broadcasted in Crimea as well) starting with 2000s or so.Or here&#x27;s a thought exercise, from another perspective: would you say if US made a poll in Monterrey (Mexico) about whether the people in there wanted to join US, and >50% of them said yes, it would have been justifiable (in at least some practical sense) to annex it?

Large ISPs are public, so this activity would appear as extra revenue (if they sell traffic data) in their financial reports and annual reports.The most likely is that ISPs are just respecting the local laws, and doing the minimum retention as required by the law (because more data storage = more costs),and that their actual fear is that someone leaks this data and causes reputation damage, so they&#x27;d avoid storing anything if they can. reply mattlutze 21 hours agorootparentISPs are also in the business of analytics [1, 2], and a significant percentage of customers hiding their traffic reduces the value of their analytic products.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bleepingcomputer.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;security&#x2F;ftc-isps-coll... 2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;surfshark.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;isp-selling-data reply drpossum 21 hours agorootparentprevThis view is extremely western, not all ISPs are obligated to show \"financial reports\", and \"shady analytics\" does not imply a user&#x27;s complete network traffic record into perpetuity.

At that point, it&#x27;s game over unless you&#x27;re using mixnets or something.If they merely monitor your computer and the end service, the correlation weakens a little with plausible deniability.The real win is when the ISP adversary is monitoring your computer and the WG servers and NOT the end service. In that case, say they see you go to WG1, and then they see WG1 going to an end service. This is also correlation, and pretty undeniable. But say they see you go to WG1, then they see WG1 go to WG2, and they have no visibility of WG2&#x27;s traffic. Then the tracking&#x27;s broken; the footprints run off into the surf.So multiple hops buy you defense in depth assuming it eventually gets you outside your adversary&#x27;s monitoring range. replyaxus 18 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Room_641A reply stjohnswarts 21 hours agoparentprevthose two are huge though, and part of any multilayered approach to security.

However, Mullvad has won me over with their business practices.Mullvad accepts my payment for a month of use at a time, and I manually renew it (after I receive a reminder) each month. If I don’t need a vpn the following month, I don’t pay for another month. I also find Mullvad works a bit better on Linux too.I just got hit with a 2 year auto renewal charge from proton for my old proton account (email, storage, vpn) for roughly $200 with no email reminder. I thought I had cancelled the auto renewal, but I apparently hadn’t. When I went to cancel it after receiving the charge, the process was full of dark patterns and offers to continue my service, ending with the inability downgrade because it required me to manually delete emails for 30 minutes to free up storage to downgrade to the free account.It feels like proton has shifted their focus to metrics and profit growth over user experience while Mullvad simply provides a great product with no trickery. reply protonmail 18 hours agorootparentPlease note that Proton subscriptions are automatically renewed, as well as that if you are using multiple services under the same Proton account, the access to all of them will be suspended if an invoice has not been cleared for longer than 14 days: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proton.me&#x2F;support&#x2F;delinquency. We cannot downgrade a subscription for you automatically, as only you can choose what data should be removed from your Proton account - it is impossible to downgrade the account to a Free subscription if it exceeds the limits of the Free subscription.However, as soon as you downgrade the account yourself and cancel the subscription, we will automatically refund you for the unused time. The refund is automatically issued in the form of Proton credits which you can use for a Proton paid service in the future, or you can request the credits to be refunded back to your original payment method by contacting our support team: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proton.me&#x2F;support&#x2F;contact. reply pwpw 14 hours agorootparentThis entire situation would have been avoided if you had sent me an an email saying, “Hey, we wanted to let you know that you are subscribed to an auto renewing plan that is set to charge your payment on file in two weeks.” Instead you have taken my money, and I have to spend my free time asking for it back.> We cannot downgrade a subscription for you automatically, as only you can choose what data should be removed from your Proton account - it is impossible to downgrade the account to a Free subscription if it exceeds the limits of the Free subscription.Add a button to delete all data in my account that appears when you tell me you can’t downgrade.> The refund is automatically issued in the form of Proton credits which you can use for a Proton paid service in the future, or you can request the credits to be refunded back to your original payment method by contacting our support teamWhat is a proton credit?

But the trail is a rabbithole, and you might not be personally satisfied with the standard of evidence. Here is a start for you: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23571653And since the link to [2] in what I linked above is broken, here is the archived version: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;iZ2l2 reply bscphil 17 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t find this credible whatsoever, and I think you should stop making this claim.The only piece of evidence in your linked comment is the now defunct blog post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200629163107&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vpnscam.c...In addition to reading like it was written by an angry 12 year old, it makes some enormous logical leaps. The facts given are that Proton has an official legal entity in Lithuania called PROTONVPN LT, UAB, and another company called Tesonet shared Lithuanian offices and apparently some business services with them. The article claims that Tesonet is a \"data mining company\" based on the following evidence:> Tesonet has its hands in “Machine Learning Solution, cybersecurity, and collection of business intelligence data” in efforts to create algorithms, that best suit their client business needs. If you read their about page, the company openly states it employs many different technologies to structure data, which is run on various services like MySQL, Anisble, collectd, StatsD, ElasticSearch, Grafana, Influx DB, Python, and Couchbase.> ALL of these names rely on HEAVY USER INFORMATION, which makes sense, considering that Tesonet is a DATA MINING company. Now, let us not forget that Lithuania itself is a NATO member that regularly holds NAZI marches.Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m not immediately convinced that Tesonet is in the business of selling user data.The article also claims that in one online Lithuanian business services directory, the CEO of Tesonet was listed as the head of PROTONVPN LT, UAB. I have no idea of the legitimacy of this claim, but it stretches plausibility to claim that Proton is secretly not a Swiss company and secretly has a Lithuanian data mining company CEO as its head.The article then goes on to make some completely unsupported allegations: \"the real question is not whether ProtonVPN is working with Tesonet, but if the provider is owned by the data mining company\" and \"Under the name of a FREE VPN service, they’ve been collecting USER DATA all along.\"Furthermore, the original source of most of this information actually comes from a Hacker News comment. The article links to a comment by the head of Private Internet Access! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17258203Unfortunately this gives the game away, because the comment is \"retracted and removed by author&#x27;s request\". Dang comments:> In addition to the redacting the above comment, we deleted several comments below by request of their authors. My understanding is that the dispute has been resolved and that the allegations are retracted.In other words, it appears to me that the true source of these rumors has retracted them and no longer believes that Proton has the claimed ties to Tesonet.Ironically, as a result of looking into this, I feel slightly more confident about ProtonVPN than I did previously.Edited to add: you&#x27;re also stretching even the blog post&#x27;s unsupported allegations in your comment, when you say that ProtonVPN is \"white-labeled\" Nord. The article makes the unsupported insinuation that ProtonVPN and Nord are both owned by Tesonet, but this is different from the claim that ProtonVPN is just Nord repackaged as a different product, as you claim here. reply DANmode 17 hours agorootparent> In other words, it appears to me that the true source of these rumors has retracted them and no longer believes that Proton has the claimed ties to Tesonet.I was nodding along, until this.Seeing someone retract a pretty specific claim like that by calling on the admins to delete, instead of leaving it up for posterity and&#x2F;or and discussing how they made the error, feels more like a legal threat was received, and some pants were shat. reply buzzy_hacker 22 hours agoparentprevI think those two are the most reputable VPNs.

What stood out most to me about them was that the government _tried_ to stay within the confines of the law. It was a very twisted, contortionist, interpretation of the law, but they did try very hard to stay within the bounds of the legal theory that allowed the program to exist.Based on the leaks, if you’d have been running HTTPS over a VPN during the PSP, it’s likely a good portion of your traffic would have evaded the program.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;everytwoyears.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;13&#x2F;tactical-privacy.html reply wing-_-nuts 19 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m not worried about my government as it currently stands.

I also made this other thing on HN today (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37062422), really cool to see ArpChat as well (guess someone went through my profile). It was a super fun project and I learned a lot about networking.I actually got a chance to use it in a totally-offline setting a bit ago, which was fun! ... however, I then found a major bug that was causing tons of latency, and I fixed it but I haven&#x27;t gotten around to building new artifacts yet, so you might want to build from scratch if you&#x27;re planning on testing it out in a real setting for some reason. I also added fun username colors and message times. I promise I&#x27;ll upload a new release soon!If you&#x27;re interested, I wrote an article about a year ago about how ArpChat works: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kognise.dev&#x2F;writing&#x2F;arp reply junon 17 hours agoparentThe readme banner at the bottom is absolutely hilarious and beautiful.

Keep playing with code! Reminds me a bit of justine tunney&#x27;s work with things like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;ape.html where someone just goes way deep on a thing that few people seem to fully understand (in her case it would be \"compiler binary format minutiae\" among other things) and then asks a crazy question like \"what if it were possible to mesh all the binary formats together into a meta-format that actually runs on all of them?\" and then conjures up this crazy thing that actually works. reply archmaster 7 hours agorootparentjustine tunney is an amazing inspiration! glad you enjoyed :) reply hiAndrewQuinn 17 hours agoprevOh heck yeah now this is what I&#x27;m talking about! Data link layer shenanigans!!For that of you who have no idea what the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is, to a first approximation it is the missing link between your MAC address (what Ethernet runs on) and your IP address (what Internet runs on). After your IP routing table, which you can see with `route`, decides what immediate next IP address to forward a packet to, then your ARP cache, which you can see with `arp`, will decide which MAC address that IP correspond to (usually your router&#x27;s local IP address).Knowing that ARP even exists is considered mild esoterica today, to say nothing of its IPv6 sibling the Network Discovery Protocol. But even though you don&#x27;t use it much in modern cloud-based deployments, knowing it exists makes your bird&#x27;s eye view of how the whole network stack works that much more holistic. reply tibordp 15 hours agoparentNot sure I&#x27;d agree about it being esoteric. Understanding or at least knowing about ARP is still very much essential for people in networking. arping is a very useful tool for seeing if machines on the same network segment are up and just not responding to ICMP pings. Anyone looking at tcpdump&#x2F;Wireshark dumps will run into it sooner or latter.It is true that software engineers may sooner run into it when debugging their home network than their application though as cloud and traditional networks are very different. reply spicyramen_ 9 hours agorootparentARP is very common knowledge for people with basic Linux, networking skills. Back in 1990s, early 2000s was a very common tool for LAN troubleshoot reply pcthrowaway 11 hours agoparentprev> For that of you who have no idea what the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is, to a first approximation it is the missing link between your MAC address (what Ethernet runs on) and your IP address (what Internet runs on)More commonly, this is 802.11 nowadays, though I guess ARP would be used at any data link layer protocol when the host needs to get an IP: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Data_link_layer reply nextaccountic 2 hours agorootparentso you don&#x27;t use arp when you connect through wifi?but if you have a wired connection and a wifi connection to the same router, will one use arp and the other not use it? reply pcthrowaway 1 hour agorootparent802.11 (wifi) uses ARP also.I meant that it&#x27;s typically (for end users) the protocol between the wireless interface (MAC) and network gateway (IP) now, rather than:> the missing link between your MAC address (what Ethernet runs on) and your IP reply hiAndrewQuinn 43 minutes agorootparentOh, I see your point now. Yes, the direct parallel of \"MAC is to Ethernet as IP is to Internet\" is an imprecise one, intentionally so: I remembered being really confused about Ethernet vs. Internet when I learned all this stuff, and this parallel was another good-enough approximation at the time for me to continue learning.What follows is non-expert commentary and I probably get several details wrong. But here is my deeper understanding:In reality, Ethernet is a really old protocol (like Metcalfe started working on it back in 1973), and the way we use it today is very different from the way it was originally imagined. In the original paper, you would hook up say 10 computers to a single giant cable and just have Computer A send data to Computer B by sending that data to _everyone_ and letting anyone who wasn&#x27;t Computer B just quietly drop the network traffic. That&#x27;s a really elegant design, in the same way a rock is a really elegant weapon, but these days we usually plug any Ethernet devices we have into an Ethernet switch and that does most of the filtering for us -- moving us from a complete graph where everyone is connected directly to everyone back to a spoke-and-hub design with the switch as the hub. But the original Ethernet _did_ end up using MAC addresses as the way to distinguish Computer A from Computer B, and so the analogy stuck in my brain as a \"wrong but useful\" model.Now 802.11, aka wifi, comes right out the box with a spoke-and-hub model. All your traffic goes through your wireless router&#x2F;switch&#x2F;modem&#x2F;whatever it&#x27;s called. Even when you want to share things with something like BitTorrent or Syncthing on the local network, Computer A&#x27;s wireless network card doesn&#x27;t usually directly transfer files to Computer B&#x27;s wireless network card - it goes from A, to router, to B. There&#x27;s nothing technical I&#x27;m aware of that stops this direct A-B transfer, since we know wireless cards can both pull and push data, but you would have to do some networking legwork to get them to be on the same subnet to do so, which probably involves a lot of manual fiddling with IP addresses or something.But 802.11 also emerged into a landscape where MAC addresses are ubiquitous, so it still uses ARP to translate between IP and MAC for reasons I&#x27;m not entirely sure of (probably practically that MAC addresses change a lot less often than IP addresses to). reply rkagerer 15 hours agoparentprevIf it really is becoming obscure that&#x27;s a shame, I&#x27;m not sure how you could pretend to understand how IP networks work without having at least cursory familiarity with it. reply ianlevesque 14 hours agorootparentWell, it&#x27;s like a series of tubes... reply TacticalCoder 11 hours agoparentprev> Knowing that ARP even exists is considered mild esoterica todayAnd you can, say, hardcode the ARP entries from other computers on your network when they have fixed IP addresses. reply gorkish 15 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s fun that it abuses ARP&#x27;s ability to include an arbitrary payload, but just to remind everyone of networking 101, thing that the author is relying on is just the simple fact that switches flood packets addressed to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff to the entire broadcast domain. You can achieve similar message flooding without having to have superuser&#x2F;raw packet permissions by directing packets to the L3 broadcast address whereupon they will (usually) be L2 flooded (Aka it&#x27;s fun to ping the broadcast address.)Using ARP doesn&#x27;t offer any particular advantage, and I would note since many modern switches do thinks like snooping arp packets, putting a high amount of bogus ARP traffic on the network could actually have some negative impact. It&#x27;s still fun at any rate and reminds me of the type of crap that I used to make when I was learning. As alluded to before, I personally would have chosen to abuse ICMP for this purpose; maybe it&#x27;s a future avenue for development. Kudos to the fun project! reply jerf 7 hours agoparentIt uses another important Networking 101 principle: It&#x27;s All Just Numbers.ARP, DNS, HTTP, TLS, on the one hand they really are the things that may pop into your head when you think about those things, but they are also simultaneously Just Numbers. ARP has access to the same numbers as HTTP. UDP doesn&#x27;t get access to 11-bit bytes. DNS does not have special CPU instructions only it gets access to. It&#x27;s All Just Numbers. And in the end you can stuff whatever numbers you like onto the line and the rest of the world is just going to take those numbers and do... whatever they do with them. reply inopinatus 10 hours agoparentprevOne of the first amplification DDoS attacks I ever saw - talking 1990s era - was to ping the broadcast addresses of unwitting campus networks with the victim’s host address spoofed as the source.This shouldn’t work today, but back then, a naive TCP&#x2F;IP implementation (which is to say, many of them) would happily participate. reply lokar 9 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Smurf_attack reply inopinatus 9 hours agorootparentAh that’s right.

We were doing VLANs using hardware from a major vendor to partition a network and discovered that while the VLANs worked most of the time, they were leaky with ARP traffic. It was causing us headaches because the machines were supposed to be sending all of their traffic through the router, but sometimes they were seeing ARP replies that they shouldn&#x27;t and were thinking that the other machines would be reachable directly, causing them to be unable to send traffic until the ARP cache entry timed out. We couldn&#x27;t get the vendor to show any interest in fixing the bug either, because they were too big to care.It&#x27;s possible this chat app could break through VLANs in certain circumstances. reply brirec 16 hours agoparentThis is interesting to me for basically the same reason — being able to send and receive ARP messages with arbitrary payloads would definitely make troubleshooting VLANs (and other L2 connectivity) easier! reply jandrese 15 hours agorootparentCheck out arping[1].But it is easy to send out arbitrary ARP requests using almost anything and watch them with Wireshark.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man8&#x2F;arping.8.html reply archmaster 16 hours agoparentprevFrom my testing, it can break through a lot of things! reply conradfr 3 hours agoprevThat&#x27;s fun!That reminds me of a chat software that I did in Delphi 3 back in 1999&#x2F;2000 (being not that much older than OP) for our LAN parties, that was basically broadcasting on 255.255.255.255 [0]It was inspired by Kali (remember Kali?

There’s some contention on this — while I think this is the most accurate and easiest explanation, networking is more nuanced than the OSI model might convey. Some would describe ARP as a level 2 or even level 2.5 protocol. For our purposes, I believe calling it level 3 makes the most sense.TCP&#x2F;IP doesn&#x27;t follow the OSI model, so the nuance of OSI isn&#x27;t directly applicable. ARP is practically defined (ref Stevens) as being in layer 2.5 (of the TCP&#x2F;IP model), so i believe calling it 2.5 would make the most sense.and i mean, ARP frames aren&#x27;t routable. so they clearly aren&#x27;t L3. reply bgorman 11 hours agoprev [–] It is also possible to configure device IP addresses directly with ARP https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jetdirect.printerdepo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;hp-jetdirect-print-serv... replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

SQLedge serves reads from its local SQLite database, and forwards writes to the upstream Postgres server that it's replicating from. This lets you run your apps on the edge, and have local, fast, and eventually consistent access to your data. SQL generation The pkg/sqlgen package has an SQL generator in it, which will generate the SQLite insert, update, delete statements based on the logical replication messages received. SQL parsing When the database is started, we look at which tables already exist in the sqlite copy, and make sure new tables are created automatically on the fly. Postgres wire proxy SQLedge contains a Postgres wire proxy, default on localhost:5433. This proxy uses the local SQlite database for reads, and forwards writes to the upstream Postgres server. Compatibility When running, the SQL statements interact with two databases; Postgres (for writes) and SQLite (for reads). The Postgres wire proxy (which forwards reads to SQLite) doesn't currently translate any of the SQL statements from the Postgres query format/functions to the SQLite format/functions. Read queries issued against the Postgres wire proxy need to be compatible with SQLite directly. This is fine for simple SELECT queries, but you will have trouble with Postgres-specific query functions or syntax. Copy on startup SQLEdge maintains a table called postgres_pos, this tracks the LSN (log sequence number) of the received logical replication messages so it can pick up processing where it left off. If no LSN is found, SQLedge will start a postgres COPY of all tables in the public schema. Creating the appropriate SQLite tables, and inserting data. When the replication slot is first created, it exports a transaction snapshot. This snapshot is used for the initial copy. This means that the COPY command will read the data from the transaction at the moment the replication slot was created.

You connect to that proxy with a regular PostgreSQL client, then any read queries you issue run against the local SQLite copy and any writes are forwarded on to \"real\" PostgreSQL.The downside is that now your SELECT statements all need to be in the subset of SQL that is supported by both SQLite and PostgreSQL. This can be pretty limiting, mainly because PostgreSQL SQL is a much, much richer dialect than SQLite.Should work fine for basic SELECT queries though.I&#x27;d find this project useful even without the PostgreSQL connection&#x2F;write support though.I worked with a very high-scale feature flag system a while ago - thousands of flag checks a second. This scaled using a local memcached cache of checks on each machine, despite the check logic itself consulting a MySQL database.I had an idea to improve that system by running a local SQLite cache of the full flag logic on every frontend machine instead. That way flag checks could use full SQL logic, but would still run incredibly fast.The challenge would be keeping that local SQLite database copy synced with the centralized source-of-truth database. A system like SQLedge could make short work of that problem. reply btown 9 hours agoparentA simple version of this is to do a very cheap SELECT * [where tenant = ...] of your feature flag table(s) to a dictionary structure in memory on every single edge&#x2F;application server, and do this atomically every few seconds or minutes.Statsig [0] and Transifex [1] both use this pattern to great effect, transmitting not only data but logic on permissions and liveness, and you can roll your own versions of all this for your own domain models.I&#x27;m of the opinion that every agile project should start with a system like this; it opens up entirely new avenues of real-time configuration deployment to satisfy in-the-moment business&#x2F;editorial needs, while providing breathing room to the development team to ensure codebase stability.(As long as all you need is eventual consistency, of course, and are fine with these structures changing in the midst of a request or long-running operation, and are fine with not being able to read your writes if you ever change these values! If any of that sounds necessary, you&#x27;ll need some notion of distributed consensus.)[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.statsig.com&#x2F;server&#x2F;introduction[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.transifex.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;native reply Omnipresent 11 hours agoparentprevHonest question: why is SQLLite needed for local? Why would you not have PG at edge that replicates data with central PG? That way the SQL dialect problem you mentioned wouldn&#x27;t exist. reply joshuahaglund 11 hours agorootparentSQLite is much smaller and self-contained than postgres. It&#x27;s written in ANSI-C and by including one file you have access to a database (which is stored in another single file). It&#x27;s popular in embedded systems like, I imagine, edge devices reply linsomniac 9 hours agorootparentprevYou know what&#x27;s faster than a local connection to Postgres? Having the database engine directly embedded in your application. No context switch. reply yashap 8 hours agorootparentprevThat is a much safer way to go for most use cases. Well actually, most use cases don&#x27;t need edge compute at all, but for those that do, this setup is indeed common, and fine for most apps:- Say we do edge compute in San Francisco, Montreal, London and Singapore- Set up a PG master in one place (like San Francisco), and read replicas in every place (San Francisco, Montreal, London and Singapore)- Have your app query the read replica when possible, only going to the master for writesIn rare cases, maybe any network latency is not OK, you really need an embedded DB for ultimate read performance - then this is pretty interesting. But a backend server truly needing an embedded DB is certainly a rare case. I would imagine this approach would come with some very major downsides, like having to replicate the entire DB to each app instance, as well as the inherent complexity&#x2F;sketchiness of this setup, when you generally want your DB layer to be rock solid.This is probably upvoted so high on HN because it&#x27;s pretty cool&#x2F;wild, and HN loves SQLite, vs. it being something many ppl should use. reply DaiPlusPlus 18 hours agoparentprev> I worked with a very high-scale feature flag system a while ago - thousands of flag checks a second.May I ask why the flags are checked that frequently? Couldn&#x27;t they be cached for at least a minute?> It does it by acting as a PostgreSQL proxy. [...] and any writes are forwarded on to \"real\" PostgreSQL.What happens if there&#x27;s a multi-statement transaction with a bunch of writes sent-off to the mothership - which then get returned to the client via logical replication, but then there&#x27;s a ROLLBACK - how would that situation be handled such that both the SQLite edge DBs and the mothership DB are able to rollback okay - would this impact other clients? reply rockostrich 16 hours agorootparentFeature flag systems are usually based on a set of rules that could be serialized and evaluated locally (this is how pretty much every open source feature flag system and feature flag SaaS works). Usually it&#x27;s based on some kind of UUID being hashed with a per-flag seed and bucketed after some set of targeting rules are applied to other properties passed in for that user. There are added features where you can stores large cohorts to do specific targeting and usually there&#x27;s some kind of local cache added to make that look-up faster for recent users.I&#x27;m not sure what the original commenter was doing but it sounds like they had some kind of targeting that was almost entirely based on cohorts or maybe they needed to have stability over time which would require a database. We did something similar recently except we just store a \"session ID\" with a blob for look-up and the evaluation only happens on the first request for a given session ID. reply vasco 18 hours agorootparentprev> May I ask why the flags are checked that frequently? Couldn&#x27;t they be cached for at least a minute?Not in that project but feature flags don&#x27;t have to be all or nothing. You can apply flags to specific cohorts of your users for example, so if you have a large user base, even if you cache them per-user, it still translates into many checks a second for large systems. reply mikepurvis 16 hours agorootparentI guess the cost of doing it precisely isn&#x27;t terribly high, but if the majority of the flags were \"off\" (eg, subsets of users being opted into a beta or something), I wonder if you cut a bunch of the queries by sending down a bloom filter.So basically you check the filter first, and if that says the feature is enabled, only then do you actually ask the real DB. reply jmull 18 hours agorootparentprev> May I ask why the flags are checked that frequently? Couldn&#x27;t they be cached for at least a minute?Not the previous poster, but it appears in the scenario, the SQLite database is the cache. reply simonw 16 hours agorootparentprevThey were being cached for at least a minute (maybe even more than that, I can&#x27;t remember the details) - that&#x27;s what the local memcached instance was for.This was problematic though because changing a feature flag and then waiting for a minute plus to see if the change actually worked can be frustrating, especially if it relates to an outage of some sort. reply zknill 18 hours agorootparentprevThe logical replication protocol sends a series of messages that essentially follow the flow that a database transaction would.i.e. a stream of messages like: \"BEGIN\", \"[the data]\", [\"COMMIT\" or \"ROLLBACK\"].So any application that listens to the Postgres replication protocol can handle the transaction in the same way that Postgres does. Concretely you might choose to open a SQLite transaction on BEGIN, apply the statements, and then COMMIT or ROLLBACK based on the next messages received on the stream replication protocol.The data sent on the replication protocol includes the state of the row after the write query has completed. This means you don&#x27;t need to worry about getting out of sync on queries like \"UPDATE field = field + 1\" because you have access to the exact resulting value as stored by Postgres.TL;DR - you can follow the same begin&#x2F;change&#x2F;commit flow that the original transaction did on the upstream Postgres server, and you have access to the exact underlying data after the write was committed.It&#x27;s also true (as other commenters have pointed out) that for not-huge transactions (i.e. not streaming transactions, new feature in Postgres 15) the BEGIN message will only be sent if the transaction was committed. It&#x27;s pretty unlikely that you will ever process a ROLLBACK message from the protocol (although possible). reply paulddraper 17 hours agorootparentLogical replication never includes uncommitted data, unless you have written an custom output plugin.EDIT: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;52202534&#x2F;postgresql-does... reply zknill 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s true for protocol version 1 that only the committed data is sent on the replication connection.In protocol version 2 (introduced in postgres 14) large in-progress transactions can appear in the new \"Stream\" messages sent on the replication connection: StreamStart, StreamStop, StreamAbort, StreamCommit, etc. In the case of large in-progress transactions uncommitted data might end up in the replication connection after a StreamStart message. But you would also receive a StreamCommit or StreamAbort message to tell you what happened to that transaction.I&#x27;ve not worked out what qualifies as a \"large\" transaction though. But it is _possible_ to get uncommitted data in the replication connection, although unlikely.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;15&#x2F;protocol-logicalrep-messa... reply runeks 18 hours agorootparentprevMy limited understanding of logical replication is that writes only happen at COMMIT. Ie. nothing is replicated until it&#x27;s committed. reply paulddraper 17 hours agorootparentprev> Couldn&#x27;t they be cached for at least a minute?Only per feature+per user. (Though 1000s per second does seem high unless your scale is gigantic.)> What happens if there&#x27;s a multi-statement transaction with a bunch of writes sent-off to the mothership - which then get returned to the client via logical replication, but then there&#x27;s a ROLLBACKNothing makes it into the replication stream until it is committed. reply hinkley 15 hours agoparentprevDoes it though? If it’s a proxy it can support the SQLite read and the Postgres write syntax. If reads only ever go to SQLite they don’t need to work on Postgres. reply seedless-sensat 8 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s nice to see another pg proxy using the pgx parser (their src[1]) - I built one using this lib too. However, this implementation is missing a lot of low level features to be considered close to compatible, including: multi-query transactions, auth, TLS, extended query mode, query cancellation.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zknill&#x2F;sqledge&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;pgwire&#x2F;postg... reply aeyes 16 hours agoparentprevHow many flags are we talking here? I implemted a similar system and we just replace the whole sqlite DB file by downloading it from the centralized storage whenever it changes.Even with 1M flags it&#x27;s still only a few 100 kB compressed.I wouldn&#x27;t replicate per user flags to the edge to keep size under control. reply yashap 8 hours agoparentprevI wonder, how does this handle a single transaction that contains both reads and writes? Maybe it just says \"within a transaction, all reads and writes go through the Postgres proxy, SQLite is ignored\"? reply ericraio 18 hours agoparentprevOne use case I can see this being valuable for is for a client based application and Postgres being a centralized database. The client would just query SQLite and not need to write Postgres SQL. reply durkie 18 hours agoprevI&#x27;m super excited for this -- it seems like it&#x27;s perfect as an app-local cache of things that can be a drop-in replacement for some high-cost queries.Are there any plans to support which tables get copied over? The main postgres database is too big to replicate everywhere, but some key \"summary\" tables would be really nice to have locally. reply igammarays 2 hours agoprevI’ve been thinking a lot about this problem of distributed databases, and so far the easiest and most innovative solution I’ve seen is PolyScale[1], basically a CDN cache at the SQL layer with smart automatic invalidation. I just don’t want to deal with the hairiness of logical replication and now sqlitepostgres incompatibility.[1] Not associated with PolyScale in any way, just an interested potential customer. reply maxfurman 19 hours agoprevThis is pretty neat! One question, if all your queries have to be SQLite-compatible, doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose of using PG in the first place? Maybe SQLite supports more PG features than I thought, but if for example your app uses pgvector or pgcrypto you might have issues here. reply zknill 19 hours agoparentYes, absolutely, and this is going to be one of the hardest tech challenges to solve. I&#x27;ve thought a little about it, and it&#x27;s probably unrealistic to think that we can translate every single PG statement into a SQLite one, especially when PG has extensions. So we&#x27;re probably destined to use the local SQLite database for queries we can parse and understand, and forwarding all the others (both reads and writes) to the upstream PG server.This slightly breaks model of having a local copy serve data faster, but if only the minority of queries use a format that we don&#x27;t understand in SQLite then only that minority of queries will suffer from the full latency to the main PG server. reply hot_gril 9 hours agoparentprev> doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose of using PG in the first placePG can scale higher than SQLite, especially considering concurrent writers. So even without the PG syntax and extensions, it&#x27;s still useful. Also, maybe you can use PG syntax for complex INSERT (SELECT)s? reply kiitos 18 hours agoprevAnd how do you manage conflicts?edit> The writes via SQLedge are sync, that is we wait for the write to be processed on the upstream Postgres serverOK, so, it&#x27;s a SQLite read replica of a Postgres primary DB.Of course, this does mean that it&#x27;s possible for clients to fail the read-your-writes consistency check. reply zmmmmm 10 hours agoprevHow \"edgy\" can real PostgreSQL be? Seems to me that this is all in lieu of using real PostgreSQL replication, on the basis that real Postgres is too heavy &#x2F; complex to run on the edge. Can a true PostgreSQL replica be configured in a light weight way to serve a similar purpose? reply hot_gril 9 hours agoparentI have the same question. There have been demos of local Postgres-on-web using wasm, which would not solve this issue (browser is way heavier than SQLite), but maybe it demonstrates how portable Postgres can be with some effort. reply rbranson 18 hours agoprevWe replicated our MySQL database to a SQLite edge at Segment in ctlstore: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;segmentio&#x2F;ctlstoreWe considered tailing binlogs directly but there&#x27;s so much cruft and complexity involved trying to translate between types and such at that end, once you even just get passed properly parsing the binlogs and maintaining the replication connection. Then you have to deal with schema management across both systems too. Similar sets of problems using PostgreSQL as a source of truth.In the end we decided just to wrap the whole thing up and abstract away the schema with a common set of types and a limited set of read APIs. Biggest missing piece I regret not getting in was support for secondary indexes. reply eddd-ddde 18 hours agoparentIs there a reason you didn&#x27;t add them when making the shared API? reply rbranson 18 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re asking about secondary indexes, it was just seen as a \"later\" feature we&#x27;d implement as a follow-up. It was definitely asked for, just never prioritized before I moved off the project. reply jonhohle 5 hours agoprevSomewhat orthogonal, but I was just thinking of looking for or writing a MySQL compatible frontend for SQLite. There’s a third party app that has removed SQLite support in its latest version and I really don’t want a MySQL database for something SQLite is more than capable of for my use case. reply sgt 17 hours agoprevA commercial offering (although also open source): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.powersync.co&#x2F; reply packetlost 18 hours agoprevWhy SQLite instead of a standard hub and spoke replication? What benefit does this provide? Being able to run your database on the client? That seems like it would be risky reply tptacek 15 hours agoparentBecause it’s running in the app’s address space, SQLite is obscenely fast for reads, so much so that you can often just write N+1 queries with it. reply hamandcheese 14 hours agorootparentIn this case though it appears that SQLEdge is running as its own process, distinct from the app, and the app sends all queries to the SQLEdge proxy. reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentThat makes less sense to me then, though the IPC cost for those reads is still much lower than a typical n-tier Postgres setup. reply singingwolfboy 12 hours agoprevDoes anyone know of a tool that will export a Postgres database to a SQLite database file? Seems like a handy way of exporting and passing around smallish DBs. I feel like this tool must exist, but I haven’t found it yet.

I&#x27;ve always found it hard to write any slightly complex SQL (i.e. not just a simple join) in a way that&#x27;s fast on multiple DBMSes. Even if both support the same syntax you need, subtle things can affect the performance a lot. But there are probably use cases where this isn&#x27;t an issue and you care a lot more about using something compatible with limited edge devices, like SQLite. reply luckystarr 19 hours agoprevHow would mutually incompatible upstream changes from multiple SQLite edge instances be resolved? You&#x27;d need user input for that, right? reply zknill 19 hours agoparentThe writes via SQLedge are sync, that is we wait for the write to be processed on the upstream Postgres server. So it operates as if SQLedge wasn&#x27;t in the request path from application to Postgres. The writes to Postgres are only reflected in SQLite when the data is received back from the Postgres server on the replication slot.This means writes are eventually consistent, currently, but I intend to include a feature that allows waiting for that write to be reflected back in SQLite which would satisfy the &#x27;read your own writes&#x27; property.SQLedge will never be in a situation where the SQLite database thinks it has a write, but that write is yet to be applied to the upstream Postgres server.Basically, the Postgres server &#x27;owns&#x27; the writes, and can handle them just like it would if SQLedge didn&#x27;t exist. reply luckystarr 19 hours agorootparentSo, the advertised performance is just for the read-part, not the write-part?As far as I understand: writing would still exhibit the same characteristics as before, while reads would never be affected by other users. reply simonw 19 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a problem here, because the write queries aren&#x27;t handled by the local SQLite databases - instead, the proxy forwards them directly to the PostgreSQL instance, so presumably the resulting changes show up in SQLite when they are replicated back down again. reply zffr 19 hours agoparentprev> SQLedge serves reads from it&#x27;s local sqlite database, and forwards writes to the upstream postgres server that it&#x27;s replicating from.I don&#x27;t think SQLite data is ever written back to the postgres DB so this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue reply maxpert 16 hours agoprevVery interesting! I have question ( out of my experience in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maxpert&#x2F;marmot ) how do get around the boot time, specially when a change log of table is pretty large in Postgres? I&#x27;ve implemented snapshotting mechanism in Marmot as part of quickly getting up to speed. At some level I wonder if we can just feed this PG replication log into NATS cluster and Marmot can just replicate it across the board. reply markhalonen 16 hours agoprevWe&#x27;re currently grappling with trying to build a system similar to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;sigma with a single multi-tenant Postgres db as the source and an SQLite read replica per tenant. Currently we re-generate the world every night. We need fine-grained control over the SQLite schema (it&#x27;s a public api we let users write sql against). Any related projects would be great to point me towards! reply hinkley 15 hours agoparentWe need a standardized WAL format. Too many people trying to write software to simulate it. reply social_quotient 57 minutes agorootparentWAL = write-ahead logging? reply hamandcheese 14 hours agoprevI&#x27;m a bit confused by this. Since SQLEdge is a proxy, you lose all the IO benefits of running an embedded in-process DB.At that point, why not replicate to a real Postgres on the edge?Maybe the expectation is that the application also opens the SQLite file directly? (But in that case, what is the point of the SQLEdge proxy?) reply e12e 17 hours agoprevThis looks neat. Any support for postgres schemas? Would be cool if this supported each SQLite chard to write to separate schema - giving each \"share\" a single tenant \"view\" while giving access to all data in the postgres instance?Or is this only public or all schemas? reply grodes 5 hours agoprevI am sick of reading \"on the edge\" reply karakanb 18 hours agoprevthis seems neat, I&#x27;ll definitely give it a look. this seems like a very suitable trade-off for a lot of applications I have worked on.does anyone know if there is a postgres-postgres version of this that is easy to run in ephemeral environments? ideally I&#x27;d like to be able to run Postgres sidecars along my application containers and eliminate the network roundtrip using the sidecar as a read replica, but haven&#x27;t seen this being done anywhere. maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be fast enough to run in such scenarios? reply djbusby 18 hours agoparentIn PG only one can use logical or streaming replication. Then all reads to the replica and writes to main.

The future is quite unknown, and things are changing very rapidly, at a pace that can feel out of control. However, when concern and worry about new technologies and how they may impact things morphs into mob-inspiring fear, dumb things happen. I would much rather that when we look at new things, we take a more realistic approach to them, and look at ways we can keep the good parts of what they provide, while looking for ways to mitigate the downsides. Hopefully without everyone going crazy in the meantime. Unfortunately, that’s not really the world we live in. Last year, when everyone was focused on generative AI for images, we had Rob Sheridan on the podcast to talk about why it was important for creative people to figure out how to embrace the technology rather than fear it. The opening story of the recent NY Times profile of me was all about me in a group chat, trying to suggest to some very creative Hollywood folks how to embrace AI rather than simply raging against it. And I’ve already called out how folks rushing to copyright, thinking that will somehow “save” them from AI, are barking up the wrong tree. But, in the meantime, the fear over AI is leading to some crazy and sometimes unfortunate outcomes. Benji Smith, who created what appears to be an absolutely amazing tool for writers, Shaxpir, also created what looked like an absolutely fascinating tool called Prosecraft, that had scanned and analyzed a whole bunch of books and would let you call up really useful data on books. He created it years ago, based on an idea he had years earlier, trying to understand the length of various books (which he initially kept in a spreadsheet). As Smith himself describes in a blog post: I heard a story on NPR about how Kurt Vonnegut invented an idea about the “shapes of stories” by counting happy and sad words. The University of Vermont “Computational Story Lab” published research papers about how this technique could show the major plot points and the “emotional story arc” of the Harry Potter novels (as well as many many other books). So I tried it myself and found that I could plot a graph of the emotional ups and downs of any story. I added those new “sentiment analysis” tools to the prosecraft website too. When I ran out of books on my own shelves, I looked to the internet for more text that I could analyze, and I used web crawlers to find more books. I wanted to be mindful of the diversity of different stories, so I tried to find books by authors of every race and gender, from every different cultural and political background, writing in every different genre and exploring all different kinds of themes. Fiction and nonfiction and philosophy and science and religion and culture and politics. Somewhere out there on the internet, I thought to myself, there was a new author writing a horror or romance or fantasy novel, struggling for guidance about how long to write their stories, how to write more vivid prose, and how much “passive voice” was too much or too little. I wanted to give those budding storytellers a suite of “lexicographic” tools that they could use, to compare their own writing with the writing of authors they admire. I’ve been working in the field of computational linguistics and machine learning for 20+ years, and I was always frustrated that the fancy tools were only accessible to big businesses and government spy agencies. I wanted to bring that magic to everyone. Frankly, all of that sounds amazing. And amazingly useful. Even more amazing is that he built it, and it worked. It would produce useful analysis of books, such as this example from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland: And, it could also do further analysis like the following: This is all quite interesting. It’s also the kind of thing that data scientists do on all kinds of work for useful purposes. Smith built Prosecraft into Shaxpir, again, making it a more useful tool. But, on Monday, some authors on the internet found out about it and lost their shit, leading Smith to shut the whole project down. There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about all of this. Smith notes that he had researched the copyright issues and was sure he wasn’t violating anything, and he’s right. We’ve gone over this many times before. Scanning books is pretty clearly fair use. What you do with that later could violate copyright law, but I don’t see anything that Prosecraft did that comes anywhere even remotely close to violating copyright law. But… some authors got pretty upset about all of it. I’m still perplexed at what the complaint is here? You don’t need to “consent” for someone to analyze your book. You don’t need to “consent” to someone putting up statistics about their analysis of your book. But, Zach’s tweet went viral with a bunch of folks ready to blow up anything that smacks of tech bro AI, and lots of authors started yelling at Smith. The Gizmodo article has a ridiculously wrong “fair use” analysis, saying “Fair Use does not, by any stretch of the imagination, allow you to use an author’s entire copyrighted work without permission as a part of a data training program that feeds into your own ‘AI algorithm.’” Except… it almost certainly does? Again, we’ve gone through this with the Google Book scanning case, and the courts said that you can absolutely do that because it’s transformative. It seems that what really tripped up people here was the “AI” part of it, and the fear that this was just another a VC funded “tech bro” exercise of building something to get rich by using the works of creatives. Except… none of that is accurate. As Smith explained in his blog post: For what it’s worth, the prosecraft website has never generated any income. The Shaxpir desktop app is a labor of love, and during most of its lifetime, I’ve worked other jobs to pay the bills while trying to get the company off the ground and solve the technical challenges of scaling a startup with limited resources. We’ve never taken any VC money, and the whole company is a two-person operation just working our hardest to serve our small community of authors. He also recognizes that the concerns about it being some “AI” thing are probably what upset people, but plenty of authors have found the tool super useful, and even added their own books: I launched the prosecraft website in the summer of 2017, and I started showing it off to authors at writers conferences. The response was universally positive, and I incorporated the prosecraft analytic tools into the Shaxpir desktop application so that authors could privately run these analytics on their own works-in-progress (without ever sharing those analyses publicly, or even privately with us in our cloud). I’ve spent thousands of hours working on this project, cleaning up and annotating text, organizing and tweaking things. A small handful of authors have even reached out to me, asking to have their books added to the website. I was grateful for their enthusiasm. But in the meantime, “AI” became a thing. And the arrival of AI on the scene has been tainted by early use-cases that allow anyone to create zero-effort impersonations of artists, cutting those creators out of their own creative process. That’s not something I ever wanted to participate in. Smith took the project down entirely because of that. He doesn’t want to get lumped in with other projects, and even though his project is almost certainly legal, he recognized that this was becoming an issue: Today the community of authors has spoken out, and I’m listening. I care about you, and I hear your objections. Your feelings are legitimate, and I hope you’ll accept my sincerest apologies. I care about stories. I care about publishing. I care about authors. I never meant to hurt anyone. I only hoped to make something that would be fun and useful and beautiful, for people like me out there struggling to tell their own stories. I find all of this really unfortunate. Smith built something really cool, really amazing, that does not, in any way, infringe on anyone’s rights. I get the kneejerk reaction from some authors, who feared that this was some obnoxious project, but couldn’t they have taken 10 minutes to look at the details of what it was they were killing? I know we live in an outrage era, where the immediate reaction is to turn the outrage meter up to 11. I’m certainly guilty of that at times myself. But this whole incident is just sad. It was an overreaction from the start, destroying what had been a clear labor of love and a useful project, through misleading and misguided attacks from authors.

What are authors supposed to take away from these reports? “Oh, my work is in the 43rd percentile for use of adverbs.” So what? The issue I have with this is not that it’s trying to replace humanity, but that it is trying to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. Quantifying these (or any other) aspects of writing and comparing them to those aspects over a large corpus of other works doesn’t tell anybody anything meaningful. Benji says: “Somewhere out there on the internet, I thought to myself, there was a new author writing a horror or romance or fantasy novel, struggling for guidance about how long to write their stories, how to write more vivid prose, and how much ‘passive voice’ was too much or too little.” But all those prescriptive concepts – “how long,” “too much,” “too little” – are (a) entirely subjective and (b) nonsensical. So all the tool provides is a quantitative analysis that serves no actual purpose. (And new authors eventually find their own voice; they don’t need a quant analysis to tell the what their voice “should” sound like.) Also, to the extent that it pushes authors to modify their writing to be more like the rest of what’s out there, it creates a risk of homogenizing literature – a problem similar to that of training generative AI on an internet that is increasingly composed of AI-generated content. Maybe the tool is legal under copyright law. But regardless, in a world where AI-generated content is being pushed hard as an alternative to human creativity, it is certainly understandable why authors reacted with alarm and anger, and it was so unnecessary.

The authors who are complaining about it on the grounds that it is “stealing” their work or that it needs authorization to do what it is doing are probably wrong and misunderstand that this is not a LLM or a prompt chewing bot.

Uriel-238 (profile) says: August 8, 2023 at 5:29 pm A stupid idea from a stupid premise I was noticing that Linken Park releases versions of its songs that separate the instrumental tracks and the a cappella voice tracks, I assumed inviting transformative use (some results of which I’d seen on YouTube), and it reminded me of the story about Micheal Jackson talking with Daryl Hall about borrowing the base line of I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do) for Billy Jean I’d expect that authors and writers who are actually published would be fine if other writers studied their material with full intent to emulate or borrow certain styles if it was a human being doing it. But right now the notion they seem to fear is not that their book will be fed into an AI in order to create additional, transformative product, but to write what they’d create in their stead. Generative AI is a long, long way from being able to write us a new Hemmingway novel, or to draw us a new Maurice Sendak book. And even content IP owners might only be able to slow the development of AI to where it’s ability to Sendak convincingly meets and exceeds the original material. But I don’t think we want to withhold all our art like Prince did, rather I think creative people who depend on those incomes are afraid of losing them and being left to the elements. We’re not afraid of AI, we’re afraid of capitalism. And the solution is not going to be in delaying AI, but confronting that exploitation of labor is going to leave more and more people unemployed and hungry until it reaches a crisis point.

Techdirt teems with articles about stupid IP rulings made by state and federal courts. If they trained [an AI] solely on all my novels and did the same thing? Is that fair use? I think what matters to make it fair use, is that it’s transformative. So yes, if you have a large body of novels, and the AI is able to create one that uses your writing style but is sufficiently different, that would count as fair use. The problem is, (at least as I understand it) generative AI isn’t making original work at the touch of a button. A user has to describe very specifically what they want, and run through a large number of iterations (like over a hundred) and then review them and cull out all the ones that are NSFL or fall to Sturgeon’s law, ultimately choosing the best example. This is a bit of a chore for a single person working the AI to create an image. It would be way to tedious for a human being (or a crew of twenty) to do the same just to make a passable Shakespearean play or Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes mystery.

Ken Analysing says: August 8, 2023 at 9:21 pm As a data scientist my worst nightmare just got true I am a data scientist who works in natural language processing (NLP) and AI. I’ve read the Gizmodo, Quartz and this article. I believe there are some things getting mixed up by people and that makes me sad and scared and even infuriated. Here is what gets mixed up and why it scares me: There is a huge difference between text analytics aka text mining, NLP and LLMs. Let me try to explain the differences and please bear with me, I try to make the stuff I do daily understandable and English is not my first language. Text mining has the dreaded mining in it’s name but it’s about text statistics.The mining stems, as far as I know, from the collection of the words within the text/s. This is where we count words calculate word frequency, compare with word lists and other texts and generate what we call sentiments on a sentence/ paragraph/ chapter or book level. We don’t have to use really fancy algorithms or computer models. Most of the time it’s RegEx aka regular expression and frequencies. We simply look for stuff like punctuation, spaces, capital letters to figure out where words, sentences, paragraphs and chapters start and end. Really basic stuff. No AI here. If you want to learn about the methods there is a great book called Tidy Text Mining Since I haven’t been able to visit Prosecraft before the shutdown, I can’t be quite sure about it, but from what I read here and in the other articles this seems to be what Prosecraft did for the most part. Then we get to NLP. That’s where the models/AI are. Text mining is nice when you have well written long texts in English and easier tasks like “which is the most common word / 3 word phrase?”. When you want to generate information like “What is the most common noun?” most people switch to language models. They are trained on texts and provide information like word types. Bigger ones like udpipe or spacy have the capacity to provide more details like names entities and better sentiment understanding. There are models that you can download and use on your computer. Some are bigger and will slow your machine down quite a bit, especially if you analyse a big dataset. But they still can run on any PC. Those models are trained on larger sets of texts usually gathered from the internet. Depending on the type of text they are trained on, they will perform better or worse on the texts you are working with. Most models perform well on well written text like news articles and literature. Especially comments in langages with complex grammar they perform quite poorly. This is where we have to retrain a model or build our own. Think for example we wanted to analyse a text in klingon But to train those simple NLP models we need labels for every word you want labelled in every sentencewithinyour training and test data. Sometimes you can use RegEx to define the entities you want to retrain. But it’s also common to manually label every entity for every sentence within your dataset. It’s tedious. We speak about hundreds or better thousands of sentences. Prosecraft might have used some kind of this magic, but probably they wouldn’t have used the text they analyzed for the training of their underlying models. And finally we have the eerie LLMs. They are part of NLP. Those are huge models. They are trained on vast amounts of data. From what I know they don’t need labelled data. They learn everything from their training data. They can still perform the analytics of the aforementioned models. But I wonder if Prosecraft would use such a resource intense tool for simple statistics and analytics. It’s overkill. It would be like cracking a nut with a sledgehammer. It’s something I see people do, when they want to show off, are new to the field, want to experiment with the new technology or need to do it because marketing wants to be cool. And from what I have read, Benji Smith is a computer linguist and Prosecraftis a private project. He would probably know better. So from this standpoint Prosecraft is analysing texts/books in form of statistical key data. They transformed text into numbers. Nothing more nothing less. They can give you an idea of a book, like arc of suspense, names of main figures, theme, mood… But not generate a new book. Now for the part that scares me: Like I said, my background is in data science. I personally would love to do something like Prosecraft. I love data science and sharing my passion and knowledge in a relatable way would make me very happy. But the way Prosecraft and Benji Smith are treated is exactly why I haven’t dared to ever start my personal project. It’s even worse for me since I live in Europe and our copyright law is … you know, you are on Techdirt… It scares me and infuriates me that there is this subliminal assumption that every one that does language processing is also using the analysed material to make a LLM and write stuff with it to earn money. First of all, nobody knows if Benji Smith really uses the books he got from the authors that didn’t provide him their work for anything but the analysis. Second of all, have you ever read a text from an LLM? They are glitchy and meh. Of course in the future there will be better LLMs that generate better text. But maybe in the future the same authors and people that now fear LLMs will recognize that it can assist them in their work. There is even a chance that they are already using LLMs like for grammar and spelling or translation or like Google… And the worst part is that this situation makes me feel hopeless. Because if we as society care so much about copyright that we stifle every one that wants to build something from a collection of works of others, how will we be able to learn? I have a baby. He is now learning by putting two things together. That’s how we learn. That’s how we evolve. Humans always did this to master something. Artists copied their masters work. Fans copy their idols. And some will get better than the original. But most are not. And so most will not be able to take much money from the original artist. I do hope that we can as a society evolve to honor the original artist by providing quotations and credentials. So that people can find the original. This way I believe the original artist gets their fair share of resources (money, reach, whatever). And I hope that this way we stop stifling our way of learning. So that there is a chance my baby will be able to find what he likes by copying it and that maybe he can create something new or to show the world what he loves. Without fear or need to doubt if what he is doing will generate a shit storm and twist every intention he had in the publics eye. But from reading all the articles about Prosecraft and LLMs, my heart sinks and I fear we are heading into a future where our natural way of learning and sharing our love for something will cause a witch hunt.

It must suck having a giant community of artists show up on the guy next door’s stoop with torches and pitchforks, calling everything “AI” and hollering about some shit that just isn’t actually happening. I spoke up about it on Twitter today and had a pretty awful time. But look, you’re not alone. We will figure out how to help people understand a) that they have no idea what’s going on right now and b) what’s going on right now. I hope you have a great night!

Anonymous Coward says: August 8, 2023 at 10:31 pm Re: Ken, as much as I sympathize with your position, unfortunately, we ARE living in a world where a) corporations are trying to replace even the creatives with machines that they think can do the job better, because look at all the good things it did in manufacturing when automation became feasible and scalable b) our economies worship “line goes up” to the point where ethics are cast aside c) anyone who tries to paint technology in a positive light will be viewed as a corrupt late-stage capitalist who wants to kill their livelihoods and force them to get a shitjob that… is likely to not exist or be, more grimly, dying in a fucking ditch in RatBumFuckistan because the only choice left is to join the Armed Forces. I have tried to read up and inform myself on the scams these late-stage capitalists are running and a lot of it runs counter to the research data scientists like you are doing. While I do hope we, as a global society, will reach the stage where we honor the creative’s right to associate, create and learn as well as everyone else’s, we don’t live in that ideal world. We live in a shitty reality where late-stage capitalists are trying to replace the jobs of creatives, backed by the successful replacement of the manufacturing workforce with machines, and their captured politicians who won’t even bother to listen to the people who voted them in power. What we’re really seeing is a massive pushback from a lot of not-Boomers who realize that their future, is, to out it nicely, gone.

Because the conclusion that large models can actually do any of that is completely conjectural and, IMO, very, very dubious, no matter how big a corpus one of them has. They fundamentally are not creative and fundamentally cannot replace creatives. Not even commercial artists, which I had thought were the most at risk, until I tried to do extremely simple shit with it and realized that even at its best its output is only useful for the novelty value of it having been thrown together with math. So all of this panic is a) for nothing and b) actually causing a ton of upheaval, as executives watch the frothing mob and conclude that AI must actually be a threat to those down below. The one thing the studios and the striking writers and actors both have in common may be that their leaders both wrongly believe AI can fundamentally shift the balance of power in the arts.

I suspect it is not really hiding anything more sinister than concern for their own survival as artists in a capitalist industry. If the only reason they are tolerated by their capitalist masters is the presumption of talent for unique content, then yes, they’re going to feel threatened by anything that might replicate it. But what threatens their jobs is not the existence of AI that can replace them, but that capitalists believe they can replace creative persons using AI. Even if it’s not true, it reveals that our publishers see art as product as ordinary as potato chips.

Steve says: August 9, 2023 at 4:53 pm Unfortunately, tech has made its bed My subject line pretty much says it all. I’ve been in high tech since the early 1980s, when it was pretty commonplace for budding programmers to write and share big systems for the sheer joy of it. Unfortunately, the last 20 years have been characterized by extreme exploitation of users (social media using users content), of employees (the entire gig economy), of customers (privacy, sharing, clawing back and charging for features, etc.), and of anyone without the power to fight back (Adobe using the Creative Cloud contents to quietly train their own IA). It’s a shame that a “good” application got caught up in this, but it’s the natural consequence of an industry that has repeatedly and consistently violated its users’ trust. Maybe when we see the major tech companies acting responsibly and ethically, people will stop getting hysterical. But at this point, assuming that a programmer has your worst interests at heart (or at best, doesn’t care about your interests one way or the other) is the most rational, safe assumption you can make.

There are some competing services that do the same thing in groups... I forget the names, but I had checked them out when I was first using focusmate. But I liked focusmate a lot more (plus it was way cheaper than the group one) bigtroublewingcong: I might have to give Focusmate a try. I have some infosec policy/procedure work that's not fun, but necessary, and requires some dedicated time to sit down and do it.

Which is...well, not helpful either Mike Masnick: no. still a clear slapp suit... should have a post later today John Roddy: Well, SLAPPs were never limited to defamation in the first place. If anything, this is a really good example of that Mike Masnick: why are you in my brain revealing what i'm writing. John Roddy: Blackmail and/or innocent purposes. mildconcern: are you sure he's not your focusmate for the day? Is that going to become a meme? probably (have you ever gotten someone who knew who you are?) Mike Masnick: nope. never. a few people have asked what i do and then asked where i write for (which is generally frowned upon in focusmate, you're not supposed to be digging too deeply into the people you're paired with), so i tell them. but no one has ever known me that i can tell mildconcern: Yeah it would be very contrary to the spirit of it if you ended up with someone who started to fanboy though now that there's a NYT profile of you with the service called out it seems more likely to happen Mike Masnick: though, amusingly, i was talking to a friend yesterday about getting together and catching up, and noting that we're both busy so it may be tough to schedule... and he said \"well, you can come by and work at my office and when we both reach a point of needing a break we'll chat -- i can be your focusmate for the day\" and i found that amusing. if i were truly obnoxious, i could hang the profile behind me. but, i'd actually die of embarrassment before doing that mildconcern: Rightfully so Right now I'm just doing my non paid version of focusmate, working in a random starbucks. The muzak just switched from \"Dance with me\" to Public Enemy. I think I have whiplash. Mike Masnick: but, honestly, there are so many people using focusmate, and the vast majority of them are unlikely to have any reason to know who i am, that i really doubt it'll happen mildconcern: Do you meet in some neutral third party or at one or the other person's office? neutral third site? Mike Masnick: for what? mildconcern: to work with the focusmate person or did I misunderstand how it works? oh I just looked it up my own damn self instead of making you the spokesperson for this service. it's virtual, I see.

Mike Masnick: Nice! Samuel Abram: Thank you, your Maz-esty! Remember when I said that someone paid $25.35 for my entire discography on Bandcamp? Someone else just did! and I get paid twice as much! candescence: So would it be accurate to say that the movie/TV studios saw what Netflix was doing, wanted to get ahead of the streaming revolution and avoid getting completely left behind like the music/record industry did, and just rushed into streaming as quickly as possible? tomacamot: I think the studios did get left behind, Netflix was the only legit game in town for a very long time. Then HBO showed they could launch and control their own and it opened the flood gates, where they rushed in and made the space terrible as quickly as possible mildconcern: It's kind of funny to contrast what Doctorow says happened with audio books and Audible became the only platform & game in town, vs the Streaming Wars where *everyone* started a streaming service and it's just an unholy mess. I wonder if part of it is that the market for TV/Movies is so much larger than audiobooks, which could never support that much diversity BentFranklin: I have purchased entire discographies before. People are like, who is Endorphwind and why does your iTunes have 27 albums by Endorphwind? Mike Masnick: i mean, the problem with both of those is the proprietary/silo'd nature of each. the better scenario is one in which you have standardized formats/playlists/favorites that you can move between services, or standardized files you have access to regardless of service. John Roddy: Also, books became digitized and marketed well before the other fields we're used to. So the aggressive DRM that plagued early versions of all those was able to become accepted. bigtroublewingcong: I don't see how the subscription model for Audible, or Audiobooks, is successful. Anyone else listen to books in a much shorter time than one month? Having to wait 3-4 weeks for another credit is odd to me. It especially sucks when you're listening to a series. There are other options of course - Apple Books, and if your local library is on Libby - but even then you might not find what you're looking for if the book is exclusively on Audible or if there's a waiting list for a title on Libby. mildconcern: in a way they do in the backend, I'm sure. There aren't really proprietary video formats in either audiobooks or ebooks or movies. The barriers between them are legal & imposed by their creators or the platforms. Which is part of what makes it infuriating when their nickel & diming corners you. Right now I am subscribed to zero streaming services. Partly because I usually round-robin them and only have one going at a time, and between a very busy June for work and being out of the country most of July for vacation, I just axed the last one and didn't pick up another. Instead I'm reading a lot of books and remarking on the fact of how little I miss streaming. For me I get the audible 1-a-month because it's a freebie for some credit card I have. I just mix in audible audiobooks with podcasts and library audiobooks in the rotation and it works out fine. For me having 6-10 holds for books in Libby at a time works out that something I want to read by listening is up at any given time. It helps that as a MA resident I have access to the Boston Public Library as well as my local town; their collection is pretty vast. Mike Masnick: Yeah, we play the rotation game as well. And I use Libby for ebooks all the time. I rarely do audiobooks, because right now i have a backlog of about 1200 podcasts. mildconcern: Hah. I did a Great Podcast Culling during my vacation because of the backlog. It was liberating. Mike Masnick: i need to at some point mildconcern: I realized I was listening to several where the hosts ran out of material for their original concept and were just shooting the shit, and similar problems. Mike Masnick: re: streaming, some of the free streaming services are better than i expected. i got sucked into \"jury duty\" on amazon's \"freevee\" thing. and tubi seems to get some good movies mildconcern: I find I prefer podcasts for short drives, walks & cleaning the house, and audiobooks for long drives & long hikes, so vacation skewed more towards books I ended up reading & listening to about six books in 3 weeks which was pretty nice. except the one written by a former student that I couldn't get past the 1/3rd point. I have to lie to her sometime about how I liked it. Right now when I'm feeling braindead I flip the Roku Channel on and it's truly one of the most amazing collections of D-movie level crap I've ever seen. Sometimes I like crap. But it's impressive. Cathy Gellis: Tubi's catalog is quite good IMO and so is the app, but I understand it may be a Fox property now? mildconcern: Didn't Fox entertainment stuff get swallowed by the Disney whale? The other reason I'm staying off paid streaming though is that a friend pointed out that it felt like crossing a picket line right now. And as much as I suspect the SAG & Writers union is misguided in some of their aims, crossing a picket line is definitely something I don't do if I can help it If nothing else, my great uncle will come out of his grave and haunt me. Samuel Abram: The WGA and SAG-AFTRA have both said that they have not advocated a boycott of streaming services, and if you want to help them, donate to the entertainment community fund: [link] This fund helps make sure that striking writers and actors don't go broke because of the strike bigtroublewingcong: Yeah, I'm envious. My local library does not have the best selection of audiobooks (at least that I'm interested in listening to), and those that are popular atm (Oppenhiemer) , there's a 6 month wait. I recently listened to Three Body Problem during a road trip and I was hooked. Finished it quick but couldn't find The Dark Forest anywhere except for Apple Books. On a side note, the preview for the series on Netflix arriving in January looks pretty good. bode000: jury duty was a great show.

As far as I can tell, the author scraped the web for books, including in-copyright books. Then he analyzed it with techniques based on \"classical\" natural language processing techniques, rather than transformers or deep learning. He appears to have retained the books he scraped for future analysis. The site itself seems to use only snippets.However, the apology [0] says that the creator did not \"intend\" to participate in AI that can \"create zero-effort impersonations of artists.\" I&#x27;m not sure if the wording is unintentionally vague, or if there is some way his project could be used in that way.For what it&#x27;s worth, the Computational Story Lab&#x27;s hendometer [1] seems to have largely out-of-copyright books from Project Gutenberg, plus the Harry Potter series.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.shaxpir.com&#x2F;taking-down-prosecraft-io-37e189797...[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hedonometer.org&#x2F;books&#x2F;v3&#x2F;863&#x2F;Edit: Apparently he was working on an LLM project. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;stealcase&#x2F;status&#x2F;1688721685585809408.

They will do this in the most confused and twisted way possible, driven by lack of understanding of what was happening combined with a need to drive outrage and thereby advertise their work.If he says he didn&#x27;t intend to do that thing, this is still compatible with a later update that he didn&#x27;t do that thing, but immediately dampens the outrage machine. The reader who knows nothing about either side relaxes -- \"No need for me to get worked up, because we won\". Conveniently, saying he didn&#x27;t intend to do the thing is also compatible with a later reveal that he was doing the thing (perhaps for later release, since he wasn&#x27;t clearly doing the thing here).Therefore, regardless of whether he was doing what he was accused of doing, this is the lowest energy response, and probably the default unless this was the hill he wanted to defend. reply bbarnett 19 hours agorootparentThe best response, for us all collectively, is to always ignore everyone&#x27;s opinion online. There is zero value in anything on reddit, twitter, facebook, the media these days.Just ignore it. All of it. Outrage or not.I see downvotes, but I mean it. You know who you listen to? Your friends.

It also exposes me to more diverse viewpoints than I&#x27;d get solely in my physical circle of friends.Now, I don&#x27;t really use reddit after the most recent shenanigans, but here I am back on hackernews like I was slashdot before reddit.

In fact, I am posting!Ignoring online comments, especially criticism, does not mean disregardment. And note, context is important. Note what I am replying to.Simply put, on a medium where one person can sockpuppet appear as 1000, where one person can rally 1000 useful idiots with one disingenuous post, one cannot care what is said.Ignore it.We already have 30 year old adults, trying to discuss political nuance online, not realising that they may be piled on by a dozen 8 year olds. People presume the person behind the text is real, the person is their approximate age, or at least an adult, that the person is debating in good faith.None of this is necessarily true, and in any large group of responses, the above chicanery is happening.No one should care what a bunch of \"people\" on Twitter say. reply slg 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m genuinely curious, why do you post here if you have this mindset? reply bbarnett 17 hours agorootparentThis is not twitter, with its tiny little snippets of text, which are useless for meaningful communication, and its culture which incites groupthink. This is not Reddit, with its hostile, hate filled voting system, with its peer pressure laden culture. This is not Facebook, literally designed to drive hate, and anger, and upset, to increase engagement.This is Hackernews. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s far more palatable. And it&#x27;s certainly not like any of the above.Lastly, my advice still applies. When I detect hate here, I ignore it. When I detect peer pressure, I don&#x27;t care. reply slg 15 hours agorootparentYour two comments here could each fit in a Tweet and Reddit has basically the same voting mechanism as HN. There is also plenty of groupthink here too. That was basically the reason behind my comment to see what distinction you are making.

It seems that both the book authors, and some of the people in the discussion here, conflate rudimentary statistics about a book (number of words of certain kind) with the latest wave of generative AI. They are very different in both what value they provide, and what risk they pose to book authors.The tool that book authors got outraged about only provides basic metrics, not dissimilar from other metrics such as \"page count\", and can&#x27;t be used to produce new content which could deprive the book authors from revenue. reply rockemsockem 16 hours agoparentIf you read through the angry Twitter thread it&#x27;s clear that almost everyone thinks that either a) the site is a pirate site that lets you download books or b) that the site lets you generate works in the style of an author.

If you read his post, the initial goal was to get stats about typical word count, typical amount of passive speech, etc. Requiring opt-in for these broad statistics, through outrage only since this project is CLEARLY legal in the United States, means that tools like this will never exist. Which seems net bad to me.If you are saying it should be opt-in only for the pages analyzing specific books, like the instigator of this outrage screen-shotted, well that seems to fall squarely into the critical analysis bucket, so that is also quite ridiculous.I understand some folks being unhappy that a portion of the works were pirated, but it seems like most of the outraged would be outraged even if he personally purchased each and every ebook.Also, if you read through the Twitter thread a lot of the authors (not 100%, but a LOT) are doing a really great job portraying themselves as \"stoopid AI-fearful luddites\".

If an author doesn’t want that to happen then they shouldn’t publish a book. Just keep it private, only distribute it to people you trust after they sign an NDA.As far as anyone knows, no piracy has occurred. In the US you are allowed to scan books, index them, and post excerpts - it’s called Google Books and there was a big case that affirmed that it is legal. Downloading a book from a pirate website for the purpose of indexing by a computer program is not piracy, you have simply outsourced the scanning stage to someone else. It is only an issue if you download from some p2p protocol (such as a torrent) that also uploads and shares the book. reply paulluuk 21 hours agoparentprevWhile I would agree in theory that a project like this would be best with opt-in, in reality that would just not work.

The attitude is, \"It&#x27;s the reality now, deal with it,\" all while enjoying the job security and high salaries of tech jobs.

There’s a pattern that I see a lot, of having:1. large powerful players doing something not entirely helpful;2. victims of that protesting that change vehemently; all that in vain because the players are powerful and have sheltered themselves from criticism, usually via lobbying;3. regulatory capture or protests go after a smaller player, which is widely advertised to accuse 2. of going too far — even when the problem in 1. is still entirely there, and now ignored.It’s definitely the case with globalization (large conglomerate benefit, people protest, and a small artisan who started selling abroad is featured being victimized by tariffs), fossil fuel (large oil extractor, climate advocate, farmer seeing fertilizer prize go up), immigration, American cultural hegemony, car dominance over cities, etc.That pattern allows larger players still doing harm to wash their morals.

Your response assumed the former and paints parent poster as wrong based on your assumption. Some writers liking the tool, just like some artists liking stable diffusion, doesn’t invalidate the original criticism or imply their ideology.Indeed my experience jives with what he said. Many AI people I’ve seen comment are very much “adapt or die” when it comes to AI technology, suggesting that writers&#x2F;artists must (even if begrudgingly) use these tools to stay competitive and see many datasets as fair game even when their authors are against its inclusion in said datasets, such as the author of this article. reply mardifoufs 20 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s no outrage in the general population.

Maybe this tool in particular is terribly useful. But you can&#x27;t blame authors and artists for taking a stance against those new algorithms that provably have the potential to automatically \"steal\" from their work. You can believe that asking ChatGPT to \"write a novel in the style of X\" is not abusing the copyright, that&#x27;s fine. And the authors can answer that they fear it has the potential to break their source of revenue to a point where they won&#x27;t want to publish anything anymore. And they are entitled to it. And maybe someday we come up with licenses that prevent the use as training data (how in the world could one conclude today that \"it is most definitely fair use\", given that this is a very new way of using IP material?). reply JoeAltmaier 21 hours agorootparentThat was the accusation, and it was misplaced here. So we agree, this is a smear campaign in this case, not a sensible reaction to a reasonable application of machine algorithms.The idea that counting adverbs is steal their work to the point they won&#x27;t want to publish anymore is clearly FUD.

Probably if you counted them manually they would be fine (and most likely they were fine before generative AI).What matters to them is that generative AI is trained from their copyrighted material, and they fear it (I would, too).The day people stop reading my blog because they can just ask ChatGPT and will get something generated (partly) from my material without any kind of attribution, I can promise you I will stop my blog. reply TimPC 20 hours agorootparentIf you want to be a pitchfork mob against generative AI at least understand whether AI is generative or not? Seems like a reasonably low bar. This was non-generative AI, it didn&#x27;t produce content it output metrics and labelled some existing content. reply palata 20 hours agorootparentWhat makes you think that I don&#x27;t understand whether AI is generative or not? What I said was that for artists who are complaining about their copyright being abused, it does not matter. 10 years ago they were not complaining, because AIs looking like ChatGPT (to users who see it as a black box) did not exist (or were not remotely as powerful).And I understand that. It is not their job to learn how the black box works. What they see is that \"machine learning models\" (which they probably call \"AI\" now), which are complete black boxes to them (and that&#x27;s justified: engineers who train them also don&#x27;t know exactly what they do, but rather test their model on some dataset and judge it from there). And those black boxes are being trained from their copyrighted work and have the potential to generate a ton of money which they will never see.You can go and say \"you guys should learn how the technology works instead of complaining\", but let&#x27;s be honest: probably you are not an expert in AI yourself, and anyway why would the artists have to care? It is a totally legit question that they have: \"Why can engineers take my copyrighted work, run it through an algorithm that does stuff no algorithm has done in history at a scale never seen before, make money out of it, and not even consider that maybe they are abusing my IP?\".Before dismissing the artists, you should try to understand their point of view. reply aaaaarrrrrfffff 18 hours agorootparentI would disagree. Just because you don&#x27;t quite understand something, doesn&#x27;t mean your concerns are not worth consideration - consider the recent zoom TOS issue. I doubt that many of us have a deep understanding of how that data&#x27;s being used, or the internal guidelines that zoom follows for its data use, and most people aren&#x27;t lawyers specializing in IP law to know exactly how the law would treat zoom if they were to accidentally (or \"accidentally\") leak IP. We just see that they are putting in a clause in their TOS to allow themselves to do so, remember our own heuristics of how LLM have behaved in the past, and understandably start raising questions. For all we know, zoom&#x27;s AI might be something constrained to a framework which doesn&#x27;t allow for such data leaks to occur, or it&#x27;s generative capabilities might be constrained in some other way. They&#x27;re just demanding legal permission to do so, but that still rubs a lot of us the wrong way. Our concerns are still justified, even if Zoom never actually touches AI. Artists lack as concrete heuristics as the technical crowd. But they still have concerns that need addressing, and those concerns about the effects of AI still should be considered and respected. If the details of the situation don&#x27;t match their concerns, care should be taken to explain how they don&#x27;t match to the people in question, in a way that isn&#x27;t looking down on them (admittedly, trying to be the calm voice is often a waste of time on the internet) That said, if you were to make an informational video which succintly summarizes the technical details that are relevant to artists, it might become sufficiently popular to influence debate. reply aaaaarrrrrfffff 18 hours agorootparent(to clarify, this is a response to skjoldr&#x27;s comment) reply skjoldr 19 hours agorootparentprev> It is not their job to learn how the black box worksIf you have not learned the basics of how something works, you have no right for your opinion on it to be considered valid.

You just need to have some a reasonably correct high level understanding of the impact of a nuclear bomb. But that&#x27;s not what is happening here.

Copyright is one such problem.> you think that the harassment was entirely justified. Is that correct?I honestly don&#x27;t know how far it went. What I saw in the article is a few authors who wrote online that they wanted their book removed from that software. Not sure if it is closer to harassment or to lobbying.What I see, however, is many comments of engineers who don&#x27;t see the problem with copyright and who don&#x27;t seem to understand why non-engineers may be against this technology, or why one would even think about forbidding a technology (\"but technology is neutral\"). My point is just that those engineers should maybe take a step back and try to reflect on that \"technology is neutral\" belief. reply rockemsockem 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you literally have no idea what a nuclear bomb does, i.e. don&#x27;t know that it explodes, releases massive amounts of heat, or can kill many tens of thousands of people at once, then no your opinion should NOT be considered valid.Understanding the consequences of something is a PART of how it works. Since you understand that it can kill a whole lot of people then I&#x27;d say you have passed the incredibly low bar.In this case most of the authors do not understand the consequences of the tool, they think it will generate convincing sound text that sounds like them or that it is serving pirated copies of their books (sourcing that from the original Twitter thread that I unfortunately read a lot of).This doesn&#x27;t seem like the thread to debate whether technology is a good thing, but I can&#x27;t help but call this assertion ridiculous.

That&#x27;s my point: engineers believe that because they have some understanding of how machine learning works (and in my experience, usually it is very limited...), they can conclude that they understand the consequences of it. Simple example: the Facebook \"like\" function, that was supposed to be positive (\"oh nice, I got likes\"), and actually increases addiction and is mostly negative (\"oh no, why did I not get likes?\"). Clearly those who implemented the first likes had not realized what consequences they would have.> Technology is responsible for almost every single good thing in the world today.If you have a very limited view of the world, I guess it could be. I like trees, flowers, bees, birds, mountains, snow. Can you tell me which ones come from technology? Let me help you: most of them are threatened to die in this century because of technology. For most living species, every single improvement technology is bad news. To the point where it is now globally becoming bad news for humans, because it&#x27;s quite likely that we will get into global instability, wars, and famines in the next few decades because of technology. Think about it when we start having billions climate refugees, and think about how you were dismissing opinions contradicting your beliefs based on the fact that you understand some implementation detail.But let&#x27;s even ignore the fact that the next few decades will most likely get pretty bad for us.

You seem to read the law, and say \"well, the law says X, new technology Y is compatible with it, so that&#x27;s legal, everyone is happy\". But that is wrong. The law reflects the society we want. Do we want a society that completely kills creative work because Big Tech found a loophole to launder their IP? I guess we all agree that we don&#x27;t. It is not clear if LLM is that loophole, I agree. But you seriously have to take a step back and think about that. What if it does? Then we may have to redefine the meaning of \"fair use\".Maybe this particular software was not a danger for those authors. But they don&#x27;t know that. And given that most engineers talking about LLMs don&#x27;t seem to remotely understand how one could be worried about it, I understand that they start speaking up wherever they can&#x27;t.

Comments are saying this project, which is not at all similar to generative ai, seemed to be okay. But you keep replying to say essentially “but if it was generative ai then authors have a legitimate reason to be angry”.There is no need to shoehorn that debate into this particular situation, and I see no merit in defending authors that had a knee jerk reaction to this project on the grounds that they have reasonable fears about other types of projects. reply palata 11 hours agorootparentI think it is not completely off topic. Here is how I see it:Engineers tend to globally think that LLMs are not really a problem for copyright holders. At least those who develop LLMs pretty clearly don&#x27;t give a damn. And on top of that, it is in their interest to not be constrained by copyrights.If this is my feeling (that engineers globally don&#x27;t care about copyright holders), then it seems reasonable to me that non-engineers could feel the same. That sounds fair, doesn&#x27;t it?So those people start speaking up when they see a situation where they feel like \"it is happening\". And because they don&#x27;t really know the technology, it is hard for them to know if this particular case is a problem or not. And they can&#x27;t really trust engineers to tell them, because engineers built LLMs in the first place, and really it does not seem like they care about copyright holders.Finally, engineers see this reaction from authors, and instead of trying to understand where they come from, they dismiss their opinion. Which probably will reinforce the feeling that engineers don&#x27;t remotely understand the concerns of those people, and keep building their AI-powered laundering machines. Again, engineers working on those technologies in big companies have absolutely no interest in even considering that it is a problem. Because they get a big salary to help their big company get more profitable, even if it kills many jobs and is a net loss for society (because they benefit from that). reply ineedasername 9 hours agorootparentTo rephrase in my own understanding of what you wrote:1) Some engineers (or more broadly, software developers) do not respect copyright2) Therefore you reasonably are skeptical of projects related to material under copyright.3) It is not always obvious if a project is respectful of copyright.Now, applying these #1,#2,#3 you believe they justify the outrage for this particular project.I disagree, because outrage combined with a lack of understanding (#3) is pretty much my definition of a knee-jerk reaction and vastly counterproductive to the interests of copyright holders because it will make the dismissiveness you predict a self-fulfilling prophecy. replyNullabillity 22 hours agorootparentprevThey… quantify the number of adverbs and voices?

IMO it&#x27;s a bit like if Facebook said that it is fair use to leverage metadata about their users, because \"someone who sees you in a public space talking to a friend knows that you are talking with that person, and it is the same for Facebook on social media\". My problem is not that Facebook knows that I sent a message to a friend now, but rather that they know who writes to whom and when, at scale.Similarly my problem is not that somebody could read my blog post, learn from it, and write another blog post. My problem is that LLMs automatically train on all written material they want on the Internet, at scale, and without acknowledging that all that material has a lot of value (and is copyrighted).I think fair use should somehow consider the scale. replyem-bee 21 hours agorootparentprevthe difference is that an machine analysis is necessarily limited and can&#x27;t account for all the factors that make a text interesting. so it is possible that this analysis rejects texts that would not be rejected by a human.it is objective but potentially biased. and it could even be discriminating if the input for this tool isn&#x27;t diverse enough. but these are the issues that can go wrong with any use of technology, and we have seen many examples of that happening. however i don&#x27;t think that is problematic if writers use it to analyse their own texts in comparison. it is however a serious issue if publishers use it to decide what to accept reply Nullabillity 22 hours agorootparentprevAgain, I don&#x27;t particularly care about whether this is allowed to exist, I&#x27;m just here to laugh at the mindset that lead to it being created.

I do believe that AI has become advanced enough to pose such a risk to us.Some creative people are using these technologies, and while it is quite human guided NOW, at some point, the guidance that humans put into it will lessen. That&#x27;s not to say that AI will ever produce a work like Dostoevsky --- maybe it won&#x27;t, but it WILL be enough to eliminate most creative jobs, and reduce them to being at most being supervised by people who don&#x27;t have much of a passion for creative works. And that&#x27;s a shame, because it will remove the passion of creativity from society.Generative fill: I don&#x27;t use it, and that&#x27;s part of my personal ban. It goes too far.

The hint is in the name: copy-right.There&#x27;s a notion, which seems to have taken off among creators who are paranoid about AI eating their livelihoods (which it might eat a chunk of) that copyright prevents people from doing anything with works they [legally] acquired other than personally read, listen, or watch it.That&#x27;s not how copyright, as it has existed in the past, works. You can do all the algorithmic processing of your ebook collection that you want. You might be able to display small portions of a book to others, depending on the situation.Quoting one or two paragraphs out of an entire book seems like reasonably safe fair use, but that won&#x27;t stop a copyright-maximalist creator (or their publisher) from suing you, and won&#x27;t stop some copyright-maximalist judge from ruling against you, so it&#x27;s probably best to minimize the amount of content from a book that you redisplay directly. But you can do all the analysis and statistics generation you want, and display those results to others.It remains to be seen what judges will do with AI generation of works based on ingesting gigantic amounts of copyrighted work. The entire framework of copyright is going to be broken, and until Congress steps in and changes it, judges are going to go every which way. There&#x27;s no bright line for 4-factor analysis; it&#x27;s always been a gut-level \"is this a reasonable use that doesn&#x27;t impact commercial sales too much\". There&#x27;s no possible rational way to draw a line. AI models can generate a painting of a new subject only loosely in the style of a contemporary painter, which would not be copyright infringement, or it can generate a near-clone of an existing work with the right prompting, and depending on how clever the prompter is, a lot of intermediate stages of likeness. Who decides how close to an existing work is too close? reply palata 21 hours agorootparentSay I make a tool where you can enter the title of a book, and get the full text of the book without paying for it. I assume we all agree that would be illegal, right?Now say that instead of distributing that tool as an executable, I distributed it as a library. It would contain all the same books as the illegal executable above, but some developers would need to write an actual executable that would use the library. Obviously that executable would be illegal (same as the first one above), but would the library be illegal? I would think that we all reasonably agree that my library would be illegal, because I would essentially be selling the content of books for which I don&#x27;t own the copyright.Now what happens when I distribute a trained model that has the potential to generate illegal work? Is it suddenly legal for me to sell it, because some developers write legal executables with it? How is that different from my library example above? reply subroutine 20 hours agorootparentGoogle Books already does exactly this. It has a library of the full text of millions of books. Users can search for a passage of text and google will display the paragraph where the passage is found.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.comexample:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.ibb.co&#x2F;DCxJpHN&#x2F;IMG-3143.jpg reply palata 20 hours agorootparentGoogle does not provide the full book, does it?

For most books I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s a few pages. Google will block you from retrieving more pages from the same book eventually. Using a VPN and a different account may get around one limit, but I experimented with multiple VPNs and browsers once, and although I was able to get a majority of a book&#x27;s pages, after that google stopped showing me full previews of any of the remaining pages no matter where the request came from. reply subroutine 19 hours agorootparentIt shows you a few pages if you are previewing the book (i.e. \"look inside\"). But if you are using search, it will show you where your search query shows up in the book, no matter what page the search query is found. This means you could theoretically search a book sentence by sentence, and it will eventually have shown you the entire book. I&#x27;m not claiming this is an efficient or practical way to game the system and read books, only that google books does contain the full copy of the book text and can reveal the contents of any passage. This is basically how Prosecraft works (at least what i glean from the article) - it doesn&#x27;t let you read a whole book, even though it may contain a representation of the full text. reply palata 19 hours agorootparentSure. I really did not mean that specifically for Prosecraft. But the article questions why authors are attacking Prosecraft \"because it does no harm\". My answer is that authors don&#x27;t (and can&#x27;t, really) make the difference in a per-case basis.At this point what they see is that LLMs trained on their copyrighted material are able to generate similar material thanks to their copyrighted material that was used in the training (that is important!), and they see that they won&#x27;t get paid for that. Of course they are scared, and they should be. And of course they will now start attacking everything that looks like it is using their copyrighted material as training data.I really don&#x27;t get why the engineering world does not get this: LLMs have the potential to ruin people&#x27;s jobs, it is not clear at all that this is legit (IMO LLMs could not do it without the copyrighted material they used for training, therefore they are derivatives of the original work), and those people are rightfully scared. reply harshreality 11 hours agorootparentI think most people who have thought about it understand the impact AI models seem destined to have on writing (and digital 2d art, soon music, and later other things). In addition to writers and voice artists panicking, see the Hollywood strikes, for instance, and what&#x27;s currently happening in the corporate world to digital artists.Copyright is not the correct tool to address it. In the U.S., the basis for copyright law is a clause in the constitution which allows Congress to pass laws to secure for limited time creators&#x27; exclusive rights to their creations, for the purpose of \"promot[ing] the progress of science and useful arts.\"If AI is going to displace nearly all of that content, at least content that&#x27;s mostly entertainment and less educational (novels, music, images, eventually movies), doesn&#x27;t that imply that AI is better at generating useful entertainment than humans are? Aren&#x27;t hypothetical laws restricting training of AI on past works to protect the market for future human-created works a direct violation of the constitution, if AI is better at generating \"useful\" entertainment (entertainment that people will buy) than humans are?To whatever extent AI can eventually displace nonfiction content in the sciences and liberal arts, which is more indisputably useful, the same argument will apply; however, it applies to fiction content first, because current AI models have more trouble with facts (trouble in the form of hallucinations, for instance). The threat in non-fiction areas of creativity is more distant than the threat in fictional areas of creativity which are not as bound to reality. reply subroutine 18 hours agorootparentprevWhy didn&#x27;t you just say that, instead of posing a hypothetical about software that may itself contain full book text which can be used to display (in this case fair-use) passages to end users? lolI think the disconnect between your point of view and mine is that I see \"training an LLM on copyrighted text\" the same as a person reading copyrighted text, which is perfectly legal. And I see violating copyright as a person or LLM reproducing copyrighted work (illegal). But using other works as inspiration for something novel shouldn&#x27;t be considered illegal, whether a person or LLM produced the work. I would even be fine with literature being treated more like music, where reproducing the essence of a piece of work (i.e. doesn&#x27;t have to be a word for word reproduction) is considered a violation. But if the LLM creates something completely new, how is that a derivative work &#x2F; infringement? reply palata 18 hours agorootparent> Why didn&#x27;t you just say that, instead ofBecause I answered to a post that was talking about drawing the line for fair use. I just shared my view of how I see it. To me, OpenAI should be responsible for not giving copyrighted material to users if they are not allowed to do it. This means that they should be sued every single time someone manages to extract what is considered as copyrighted material from their software.

    "originBody": "Home Making AMD GPUs competitive for LLM inference Aug 9, 2023 • MLC Community TL;DR MLC-LLM makes it possible to compile LLMs and deploy them on AMD GPUs using ROCm with competitive performance. More specifically, AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX gives 80% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4090 and 94% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3090Ti for Llama2-7B/13B. Besides ROCm, our Vulkan support allows us to generalize LLM deployment to other AMD devices, for example, a SteamDeck with an AMD APU. Background There have been many LLM inference solutions since the bloom of open-source LLMs. Most of the performant inference solutions are based on CUDA and optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. In the meantime, with the high demand for compute availability, it is useful to bring support to a broader class of hardware accelerators. AMD is one potential candidate. Discussion on the Hardware and Software From the spec comparison, we can see that AMD’s RX 7900 XTX is a good match for NVIDIA’s RTX 4090 and RTX 3090 Ti. All have 24GB memory, which means they can fit models of the same size. All have similar memory bandwidth. 4090 has 2x more FP16 performance than 7900 XTX, while 3090 Ti has 1.3x more FP16 performance than 7900 XTX. Lantency sensitive LLM inference is mostly memory bound, so the FP16 performance is not a bottleneck here. RX 7900 XTX is 40% cheaper than RTX 4090. It is harder to compare the price of 3090Ti as that was a previous generation. We put it here as a reference point to provide more information. At a high-level, we can find that AMD 7900 XTX is comparable to RTX 3090 Ti from the hardware spec perspective. Hardware is not necessarily the reason why AMD lagged in the past. The main gaps were due to a lack of software support and optimizations for the relevant models. There are two factors in the ecosystem that starts to bring changes to the picture: AMD is trying to catch up with investments in the ROCm stack. Emerging technologies like machine learning compilation helps to reduce overall cost of more universal software support across backends. In this post, we are taking a deep look at how well AMD GPUs can do compared to a performant CUDA solution on NVIDIA GPUs as of now. Machine Learning Compilation for ROCm What is machine learning compilation (MLC). Machine learning compilation is an emerging technology that compiles and automates the optimization of machine learning workloads. Instead of crafting specific kernels for each individual backend like ROCm or CUDA, an MLC solution automatically generate code for different backends. Here we leverage MLC-LLM, an ML compilation-based solution that offers high-performance universal deployment for LLMs. MLC-LLM builds on top of Apache TVM Unity, a machine-learning compilation stack that offers productive Python-first development and universal deployment. MLC-LLM brings state-of-the-art performance for a wide variety of backends, including CUDA, Metal, ROCm, Vulkan, and OpenCL, spanning both server-class GPUs to mobile (iPhone and Android). At a high level, the framework lets the user take open language models and compiles it with Python-based workflow, including APIs to transform computational graphs, optimize the layout and scheduling of GPU kernels, and deploys it natively on platforms of interest. MLC for AMD GPUs and APUs. There are several possible ways to support AMD GPU: ROCm, OpenCL, Vulkan, and WebGPU. ROCm stack is what AMD recently push for and has a lot of the corresponding building blocks similar to the CUDA stack. Vulkan is the latest graphics standard and offers the widest range of support across GPU devices. WebGPU is the latest web standard that allows the computation to run on web browsers. While there are so many possible ways, few ML software solutions that build for solutions other than CUDA, largely due to the engineering cost to replicate a stack for a new hardware or GPU programming model. We support automatic code generation without having to recraft GPU kernels for each and bring support to all these ways. This being said, the performance still depends on how good the low-level GPU runtimes are and their availability in each platform. We pick ROCm for Radeon 7900 XTX and Vulkan for Steamdeck’s APU. We find that ROCm stack works out of the box. Thanks to the productive Python-based development pipeline in TVM unity, we spent a few more hours to further bring an optimized version. We made the following things to bring ROCm support: Reuse the whole MLC pipeline for existing targets (such as CUDA and Metal), including memory planning, operator fusion, etc. Reuse a generic GPU kernel optimization space written in TVM TensorIR and re-target it to AMD GPUs. Reuse TVM’s ROCm code generation flow that generates low-level ROCm kernels through LLVM. Finally, export generated code as a shared or static library that can be invoked by CLI, Python and REST APIs. Benchmark with MLC Python Package We benchmarked the Llama 2 7B and 13B with 4-bit quantization. And we measure the decoding performance by setting a single prompt token and generating 512 tokens. All the results are measured for single batch inference. For single batch inference performance, it can reach 80% of the speed of NVIDIA 4090 with the release of ROCm 5.6. Note on the comparison: How strong is our CUDA baseline? It is the state-of-the-art for this task to the best of our knowledge. We believe there is still room for improvements, e.g. through better attention optimizations. As soon as those optimizations land in MLC, we anticipate both AMD and NVIDIA numbers improved. If such optimizations are only implemented on NVIDIA side, it brings the gap up from 20% to 30%. And therefore, we recommend putting 10% error bar when looking at the numbers here Try it out yourself We provide prebuilt wheels and instructions to reproduce our results on your own devices. To run those benchmarks, please ensure that you have an AMD GPU with ROCm 5.6 or above running in Linux. Follow the instructions here to install a prebuilt MLC package with ROCm enabled: Run the Python script below that uses our MLC package to reproduce performance numbers: from mlc_chat import ChatModule # Create a ChatModule instance that loads from `./dist/prebuilt/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf-q4f16_1` cm = ChatModule(model=\"Llama-2-7b-chat-hf-q4f16_1\") # Run the benchmarks output = cm.benchmark_generate(\"Hi\", generate_length=512) print(f\"Generated text:\\n{output}\\n\") print(f\"Statistics: {cm.stats()}\") # Reset the chat module by # cm.reset_chat() MLC-LLM also provides a CLI that allows you to chat with the model interactively. For ROCm it requires to build the CLI from source. Please follow the instructions here to build the CLI from source. Running on SteamDeck using Vulkan with Unified Memory Let us also look into a broader set of AMD devices, more specifically, SteamDeck equipped with an AMD APU. While the GPU VRAM available in ROCm is capped to 4GB in BIOS, the Mesa Vulkan driver has robust support that allows the buffer to go beyond the cap using unified memory up to 16GB, which is sufficient to run 4bit-quantized Llama-7B. These results shed some light on how a broad spectrum of AMD devices can be supported for more diverse set of of consumers. Discussion and Future Work Hardware availability has become a pressing issue in the age of generative AI. ML compilation can help by bringing high-performance universal deployment across hardware backends. Given the presented evidences, with the right price and availability, we think AMD GPUs can start to be useful for LLM inference. Our study focuses on consumer-grade GPUs as of now. Based on our past experiences, MLC optimizations for consumer GPU models usually are generalizable to cloud GPUs (e.g. from RTX 4090 to A100 and A10g). We are confident that the solution generalizes across cloud and consumer-class AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, and will also update our study once we have access to more GPUs. We also encourage the community to build solutions on top of the MLC universal deployment flow. This post is part of the ongoing effort that brings high-performance universal deployment via MLC. We are also actively working on several areas that can generalize our study. Enable batching and multi-GPU support; Integration with PyTorch ecosystem; Empowering more quantization and model architectures; Bringing in more automatic optimizations on more hardware backends. Our final takeaway is that machine learning system engineering is a continuous problem. NVIDIA is still leading the field with continuous innovations, and we anticipate the landscape to change with new hardware such as H100 and, more importantly, software evolutions. So the key question is not only about building the right solution now but also how to catch up and bring ML engineering to new platforms continuously. Productivity in machine learning engineering is the key here. Thanks to the Python-first ML compilation development flow, we get ROCm-optimized support in a few hours. We anticipate related approaches to become even more useful as we explore more ideas to bring universal deployments and solve the hardware availability problem.

Glad it’s on HackerNews!There are two points I personally wanted to make through this project:1) With a sufficiently optimized software stack, AMD GPUs can be sufficiently cost-efficient to use in LLM serving; 2) ML compilation (MLC) techniques, through its underlying TVM Unity software stack, are the best fit in terms of cross-hardware generalizable performance optimizations, quickly delivering time-to-market values, etc.So far, to the best of our knowledge, MLC LLM delivers the best performance across NVIDIA and AMD GPUs in single-batch inference on quantized models, and batched&#x2F;distributed inference is on the horizon too. reply gsuuon 5 hours agoparentCongrats Junru!

I will be staying on nvidia for now, but applaud any progress towards much needed credible competition in the consumer&#x2F;enthusiast AI hardware space.One question: given your experience, when would you predict a near parity in software stack support between te different platforms, so that a choice of GPU becomes one mostly of price&#x2F;performance? It does not need to be like the AMD&#x2F;Intel in the CPU market where a consumer will have no doubts about software compatibility, but let&#x27;s say like the gaming gpu market where a game having problems on a gpu architecture is a newsworthy exception that is quickly corrected. reply KingOfCoders 5 hours agoparentprevCan I use two at the same time?

To do commercial work you&#x27;re going to need more RAM than consumer cards have.

A minor nitpick though - why is the price of the 3090Ti stated as almost 2k USD? I guess the card might be hard to get new and this might indeed be the price somewhere, but since it&#x27;s a previous generation, in my opinion it would make sense to use the price of a 2nd hand (probably under 1k USD, depending on place &#x2F; luck).BTW - that&#x27;s exactly the dillema I&#x27;m pondering now when thinking about a new PC build to play with some machine learning &#x2F; LLMs. In my personal situation, 7900XTX and 3090Ti are about the same price &#x2F; TDP &#x2F; profile. Almost the only difference is then CUDA vs ROCm and the fact that one is new and might therefore give me some basic warranty. reply tails4e 12 hours agoprevBeing 90% of a 4090 makes the 7900 xtx very attractive in a cost per compute perspective, as its about 65%, and power is significantly lower too reply tbruckner 10 hours agoparentIsn&#x27;t it closer to 80%?

By which I mean, given current chips, how much RAM could you theoretically bolt on to these cards before the limiting factor in performance is the GPU instead of RAM? And does that change when the task is training vs. deployment&#x2F;prompting? reply coherentpony 10 hours agoparentWhat do you mean? Are you talking about capacity? Or bandwidth from RAM?I&#x27;m in the HPC space, and pretty much everything I do on the GPU is bound by how quickly I can get data in and out of DRAM.The point at which data motion to&#x2F;from DRAM is not the bottleneck is when you do enough work per byte of data moved. How much work is that? On today&#x27;s server GPUs it&#x27;s in the region of 50--100 double precision floating point operations per byte. You can work out an exact number by taking the theoretical maximum floating point operations per unit time you can execute and divide by DRAM throughput (data moved per unit time).O(50--100) double precision flops per byte is a _lot_ of work. We&#x27;re talking BLAS-3 type operations. Anything level 2 or lower, or sparse operations, are typically bandwidth bound. reply BobbyJo 9 hours agorootparentThe problem with a lot of machine learning algorithms is that you do hundreds or even thousands of operations per-value, but you do it in specialized orderings on incredibly large numbers of values, forcing you to swap partitions in and out of RAM. So, while you may do thousands of ops per-value, you may only be able to do tens of ops per-value per-write to RAM.The more RAM you have on device, the fewer swaps you need to do (none at all if it&#x27;s big enough), and the less those operations get amortized, bringing you closer to theoretical max throughput.Matrix multiples are such that going from fitting 75% of your values to fitting 100% of your values can mean an order of magnitude speedup. reply coherentpony 5 hours agorootparentDisclaimer: I have no idea how machine learning algorithms work.I work with problems so huge they do not fit on a single device. Multiple devices each own a small piece of the global problem. They solve a local problem and they must communicate over a network in order to solve the global problem. This is almost universally true.You would know more than I in this field, and I expect it really is better to swap a partition than it is to use a network.There are certain methods in HPC applications that are almost universally avoided because of how terribly they scale to a large distributed memory system. Matrix multiplies are one of them. Outside of a handful of ab initio computational chemistry algorithms (which are incredibly important), basically the only reason someone does a large dense matrix-multiply on a supercomputer is usually because they&#x27;re running a benchmark and they&#x27;re not solving a real science problem.Folks more knowledgeable than me here feel free to jump in. reply brucethemoose2 8 hours agoparentprevThe ideal ram capacity is determined by the biggest available model you want to run. So... ~48GB for llama 70B? Maybe more with batching and very long contexts.RAM bandwidth is basically always going to be a bottleneck. Microsft&#x27;s proposal to get around this is to just keep everything in SRAM and pipe chips together. reply gok 3 hours agoprevMemory bandwidth for unbatched decoder-only autoregressive inference should be the only bottleneck.

News Podcasts RadioActive Support Connect Events Search Listen Live Schedule Sign In / / Sign Up Donate NEWS & STORIES LOCAL Claudio Schwarz / Unsplash Seattle becomes first in U.S. to protect gig workers from sudden 'deactivation' David Hyde August 08, 2023 / 6:46 pm PLAYING 1 MIN left The Seattle City Council passed legislation Tuesday that would protect gig workers from being suddenly kicked off apps like Instacart or DoorDash. It’s the first gig worker protection measure of its kind in the entire country. “This will help prevent homelessness, fight displacement, and allow families to meet their basic needs,” said Councilmember Lisa Herbold, who sponsored the bill. According to Herbold, gig workers are being unfairly terminated, or \"deactivated,\" as the companies call it. Workers told the council of being kicked off an app for refusing too many orders, for example, or for delays that are beyond their control. “They actually open up the app to begin the work and they're not able to access it without receiving any advanced notice, much less an opportunity to dispute it,” Herbold told KUOW. \"Often, there's an algorithm that makes the decision so it's not even a real person who's making the decision to deactivate the worker.\" The ordinance sets a higher bar for when companies can “deactivate” workers. Not taking enough orders is not considered an acceptable reason. The law also requires the companies to give 14 days notice of termination. The move is part of a broader effort to protect non-unionized gig workers by labor advocates including the group Working Washington and their allies on the Seattle City Council. Other recent Seattle laws raised the minimum wage for app-based workers and provided sick time and benefits. “We need to really make sure that we're passing good labor protections for people who aren't legally considered employees but they're doing important work in our communities,” Herbold said. After pushback from the app companies, the original draft of the bill was revised to include exceptions for \"egregious behavior\" that could, for example, pose a danger to customers. In those cases, workers can still be deactivated quickly. In the end, the measure passed the council 6-2, with council members Sara Nelson and Alex Pedersen voting against it. Both said one reason for their no vote is that the ordinance includes workers for “marketplace network company apps,” such as Rover and TaskRabbit, where gig workers set their own rates and contract directly with people in their homes. Other gig-worker laws that passed recently in the city excluded those workers, but this one did not, Nelson said. The measure goes next to Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell's desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.

One day, while working, my account was blocked, and I would couldn&#x27;t pick up any more passengers. I was 2 hours away from home. Apparently, one of the customers had filed a complaint about a missing item (gloves or some bs like that), it was not in my car. My account was blocked until the case was \"reviewed\". So I had to drive back 2 hours without picking up any passengers. (The passenger later found the item in their bag) reply notyourwork 8 hours agoparentThere should be a way to codify law that requires companies to provide compensation for the trouble. Companies far too commonly assume guilty until proven innocent. It puts all the responsibility on the consumer because they want to avoid liabilities. reply qbasic_forever 8 hours agorootparentYeah the law should be gig work is illegal and the OP should have been classified as a part time or full time worker who would have been paid for the entire time on the clock during the work day, including the time wasted while the company toiled to resolve a customer dispute. reply chongli 7 hours agorootparentMy dad drives for Uber Eats as well as Skip the Dishes (a Canadian gig work food delivery app). He gets paid more per hour on Skip but the app will not allow him to work as much as he wants, it forces him to sign up for 3-4 hour shifts a week ahead of time. Sometimes Skip will only give him 1-2 shifts in a week (8 hours total work), which is simply not enough money to get by.So he uses Uber Eats to pick up the slack. The app lets him go online and go offline any time he wants — no shifts, no scheduling ahead. He’s also completely free to reject as many orders as he wants until he gets ones that offer a bigger tip. Skip, on the other hand, penalizes his earnings if he falls below 80% moving average accept rate (over the last 10 orders).If Uber were forced to employ all of their drivers full- or part-time, he would lose all of the flexibility he now enjoys. He’d have scheduled shifts and have to clock in and clock out at specific times on specific days. He’d likely also lose the ability to reject orders entirely.I can tell you right now, he would hate that. So would many other gig workers, who take full advantage of the flexibility to be able to look after their families and otherwise live their lives. Compare that with the chaos that is the life of a retail worker stuck with an automated shift scheduling system and zero start&#x2F;stop time consistency and zero flexibility. reply qbasic_forever 6 hours agorootparentDo you realize what you&#x27;re saying? Gig company A only dribbles out 8 hours of work a week so your Dad is forced to also work for gig company B, but needs flexible hours to do so.You are completely failing to see my point--if gig company A had to employ your Dad as a part time or full time employee with guaranteed minimum wage or work hours and other benefits he wouldn&#x27;t have to tetris together an insane set of gig work jobs to keep from being evicted or starved.Your dad is forced to be an indentured servant for these companies that can&#x27;t make money without exploiting people like him. And somehow you are immediately going to bat for these employers... pretty sick IMHO. reply jvmfjvfjvf 6 hours agorootparent\"Your dad is forced to be an indentured servant for these companies\"His dad can work at anytime, anywhere and doesn&#x27;t have a boss to mandate when he clocks in. How is that being an indentured servant? reply qbasic_forever 6 hours agorootparentHe DOES have a boss that mandates when he needs to work--the apps penalize him if he isn&#x27;t taking rides and eventually cut off his work entirely if he isn&#x27;t taking them (which is the whole point of the original article and legislation in Seattle!). reply ffhhttt 4 hours agorootparentThat’s exactly how an app which treated him as a part-time worker would work. If you stopp accepting every ride that’s offered to you, you get fired. What else would you expect?I find it so puzzling that some people can’t accept that there are gig workers who prefer the flexibility and many of them wouldn’t be able to work at all if they had to be treated as part&#x2F;full time. reply jvmfjvfjvf 6 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely wrong. There are no penalties for not working. I&#x27;ve done that myself. Further to equate a \"boss\" to an app is quite a leap. reply qbasic_forever 6 hours agorootparentThe commenter explicitly says to the contrary:> Skip, on the other hand, penalizes his earnings if he falls below 80% moving average accept rate (over the last 10 orders). reply lalopalota 6 hours agorootparentThe commenter also says nothing about being penalized for not taking shifts. If they sign up for a shift, they are expected to work that shift. It is a completely different model than Uber Eats, which he can sign into or out of at any given time, without penalty. reply ffhhttt 4 hours agorootparentprevIf so if uber was forced to employ all of their workers how else would to expect it to work than that?Certainly your ability to reject jobs or even to select the time you want to work would be severely limited (but let’s ignore that..) reply chmod775 4 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re not his employer so they shouldn&#x27;t penalize him. If you&#x27;re truly a gig worker, why are you being penalized for not accepting some job? How does that make sense?If they were employing him, penalizing him for declining work would be fine. reply ffhhttt 4 hours agorootparentIs Uber penalizing him? No.Any company which would have to directly employ him would certainly penalize him for not accepting work and would not allow him to start his shift whenever he wanted.That other app he’s using seems to be somewhere in between gig and normal work (so you seem to get the worst from both worlds).> If they were employing him, penalizing him for declining work would be fine.Which seems like a huge downside? reply jvmfjvfjvf 6 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re talking about a different app not Uber, which doesn&#x27;t penalize per acceptance rates. Besides, I don&#x27;t think you understand how these gig apps work. You can only accept or reject if you&#x27;re clocked into a shift. His dad can clock in at anytime but he won&#x27;t be penalized on Skip if he&#x27;s not clocked in. reply AndyMcConachie 48 minutes agorootparentprevThis discussion of work like something that people can whenever they want, however they like feels so off base to me. It&#x27;s work. It&#x27;s something that people have to do in order to survive and live. Yet for people who promote the flexibility of gig workers it gets talked about like a sport or some other fun activity of choice.It all comes down to trade offs in the end. Either we optimize for people to hold jobs that allow them to survive in society and earn enough to do things like pay rent and buy food. Or we optimize for job dabblers who don&#x27;t really need the work but want some extra cash. I believe we should optimze for people to hold steady jobs that allow them stability and do important stuff like pay rent and buy food. We should optimize for survival of the worker and workers require steady employment. reply sokoloff 13 minutes agorootparentThere are plenty of people who can only work part-time yet may still need money. People in school, people with young kids, people with medical conditions that limit their activities (sometimes variably by day&#x2F;time), etc.Not everyone doing gig work is hustling as a second job to get ahead (though that should also be both legal and accepted, IMO). reply zmgsabst 40 minutes agorootparentprevWhy don’t we optimize for both and allow the market to decide where each model is best suited to provide services?Eg, ridesharing can be done ride-by-ride by people choosing to accept fares from a marketplace but stocking store shelves works better having people there on committed shifts and delivering packages is in between, where people sign up for shifts but are expected to complete the full shift.Why can’t we fulfill the needs of both people who want reliable, shift-based employment and people who want variable gigs? reply komali2 5 hours agorootparentprev> His dad can work at anytime, anywhere and doesn&#x27;t have a boss to mandate when he clocks in.That&#x27;s not exactly true if we consider the environment that allows companies to operate like this, insomuch as his dad will eventually starve or be homeless if he doesn&#x27;t eventually clock in. Hence the indentured servitude. The \"worker&#x27;s choice\" of \"just do gigs for a different gig company\" doesn&#x27;t really work if all gig companies stand together at the other side of the homelessness cannon. reply ahtihn 4 hours agorootparent> his dad will eventually starve or be homeless if he doesn&#x27;t eventually clock in.How are traditional full time jobs not even worse then? They require you to clock in at times chosen by the employer or you lose the job and income. reply PixyMisa 3 hours agorootparentprevIf you don&#x27;t work, you don&#x27;t eat. reply aikinai 6 hours agorootparentprevI’m not GP, but I think you’re missing their point. They described the Canadian job as “gig” but it’s actually structured more like more traditional part time work. It sounds like you’d prefer to outlaw all part time work?The point is true gig work allows you the flexibility to fit it around whatever else you have going on, be that part time work, starting a startup, taking care of a family, etc. of course it’s downsides and probably needs some more rules to protect the workers. But banning eliminates the opportunity entirely.It sucks to be a freelance writer and it’s easy to get screwed; should we ban that too? reply hedora 6 hours agorootparentPersonally, I think part time jobs should have to come with the same benefits as full time, by law.That would encourage companies to offer full time positions. Current law (in the US) financially penalizes full time employers, which is why most part time workers end up working multiple part time jobs. reply chongli 5 hours agorootparentMy dad (and loads of other gig workers) don’t want full time Uber jobs. They like gig work because it gives their lives flexibility. The employer-employee relationship is about more than money & benefits, it’s about power.A full time job gives your employer the power to dictate your life schedule to you. Your boss wants you at your desk at 8am but you have to take your kid to school at 8:30? Too bad! You’re there at 8 or you’re fired.It’s even worse in retail and food service, as I alluded to in my original post. These workers get their schedules a week ahead, with shifts all over the place. One day you’re opening at 6am. Next day you’re closing at 9pm. Good luck having any kind of life outside of work with a schedule like that! reply alborzb 3 hours agorootparentprev> \"part time jobs should have to come with the same benefits as full time, by law.\"All this does is eliminate more jobs.In your hypothetical scenario, a company that hires 2 or 3 people part-time would need to do health insurance for each of them, benefits for each of them and the additional full-time equivalent paperwork for each of them...In that scenario, the company would end up just hiring 1 person full-time for the hours, and have much less added overhead costs.This would lead to higher unemployment, because now instead of 3 people being employed part-time, only 1 person is employed.Where&#x27;s the good in that? Maybe I&#x27;m just not seeing it from my perspective, if anyone else can chime in? reply gkmcd 2 hours agorootparentDo you know this is exactly how it works in most first world countries already? (except for the health insurance bit, because most first world countries have a public health system). Part-time workers get holiday pay, sick leave, and every entitlement of full-time workers, at a rate commensurate with their hours. reply PixyMisa 3 hours agorootparentprevThis has been tried.It results in eliminating part-time jobs, overloading full-time employees, and increasing unemployment. reply tremon 1 hour agorootparentincreasing unemploymentThat is irrelevant, because of how it&#x27;s measured: 1 person working 40 hours&#x2F;week and 9 people not working gives an unemployment of 90%, but 10 persons working 4 hours&#x2F;week gives an unemployment of 0% -- but both scenarios have the same amount of work. Of course using part-time jobs reduces the unemployment figures. It says nothing, however, about the availability of work. reply jamilton 6 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t sound like Skip pays hourly though, so it&#x27;s not very similar to part time work at all. reply qbasic_forever 6 hours agorootparentprevNope, I said none of those things like banning part time work that you are saying.Your only comment here is to try to pivot into other arguments that you are inventing. Not gonna work here. reply fragmede 5 hours agorootparentprevIt sucks to be seven years old and work in a textile factory, and they totally get screwed. So we chose to ban that. Slavery is another labor practice we&#x27;ve banned. Not sure what your point is about freelance writers. reply ffhhttt 4 hours agorootparentFreelance writer are essentially gig workers and therefore slaves or underage factory workers according to you bizarrely nonsensical analogy reply PixyMisa 6 hours agorootparentprevIf gig company A had to employ your Dad as a part time or full time employee with guaranteed minimum wage or work hours and other benefits he wouldn&#x27;t have a job. reply qbasic_forever 6 hours agorootparentThe demand for food delivery still exists and plenty of other companies would fill the void, that&#x27;s how the free market works. Right now these apps are exploiting workers so they can pocket more money for shareholders and paper over a failing business model. reply kelnos 3 hours agorootparentLove how you talk about the \"free market\" here, but also insist that certain types of employment should be illegal. (As an aside: we don&#x27;t have a free market. Such a thing doesn&#x27;t actually exist in the real world.)I don&#x27;t think we need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Certainly there&#x27;s some legal regime where workers can continue to enjoy the kind of work time flexibility they have with gig work, while also being compensated and treated fairly. reply ffhhttt 4 hours agorootparentprevHowever they would have no incentives to hire people who prefer highly flexible work hours and would force his dad to work fixed shifts which clearly not something many gig workers prefer (and I’m sure many of them would prefer higher grade pay for instance than whatever you’re proposing). reply troupo 4 hours agorootparentprevThe only reason Uber exists to begin with is because they:- have unlimited VC money (35 billion in operational losses over 10 years)- offload things like medical insurance, depreciation, equipment costs etc. onto people who work for them- screw over restaurantsI can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a net benefit reply PixyMisa 3 hours agorootparentUber is a terrible company, yes. Always has been. reply komali2 5 hours agorootparentprevIf the best the current system can offer is \"either debase yourself like a peasant into multiple gig jobs that regularly screw you, or, be homeless, and sorry there&#x27;s just nothing we can do about that\" eventually people are going to start considering other systems.Social unrest is bad for business. I&#x27;m not sure why companies keep turning the screws when profits are at record highs. reply chongli 5 hours agorootparentTo be honest, I think Skip and Uber Eats are either struggling or in a seasonal down cycle right now. Very few orders coming in, and it’s not just my dad. He talks to the other drivers out there and they say the same thing.I think on the one hand maybe a lot of people are away on summer vacation so not ordering food as often. On the other hand, interest rates in Canada have shot through the roof, so maybe a lot of people are cutting back on ordering in and choosing to cook more to save money.Unfortunately, interest rates also affect my dad, so he’s getting squeezed pretty hard. I can’t blame the gig companies for that though, that’s the Bank of Canada’s doing. reply ffhhttt 4 hours agorootparentprevConsidering current labor shortages it wouldn’t be at all unreasonable to conclude that many gig workers do this because they actually prefer the flexibility these app provides to working fix shifts with almost no way to influence tour schedules yourself. All these champagne socialists seem to ignore that for some reason.. reply komali2 2 hours agorootparentIn some ways gig work can provide a level autonomy not normally available to the people taking gig work, sure, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that gig workers are exploited, and that&#x27;s bad.If the alternative is more degrading forms of labor, with businesses sneaking around full time protections by only giving people 30 hours of work, and paying an absurdly low minimum wage, that&#x27;s hardly an indictment of the idea of strong labor protections - quite the opposite. Why did you bring up socialism? Are you saying capitalism can&#x27;t provide good labor conditions and we need socialism to do so? Extremely based take. reply PixyMisa 3 hours agorootparentprev> If the best the current system can offer is \"either debase yourself like a peasant into multiple gig jobs that regularly screw you, or, be homeless, and sorry there&#x27;s just nothing we can do about that\"It&#x27;s not. Gig work is one of many options.You can be a full-time employee. You can be a part-time employee. You can start your own business. You can work for local, state, or federal government in innumerable roles.Or, if it suits you, you can be a gig worker.Focus on specific cases of companies treating workers unfairly, as this legislation appears to do. There&#x27;s no point railing against \"the system\" because there is no \"system\". replyChainOfFools 3 hours agorootparentprevWhen what you want is full-time work with benefits, and all of the fixed schedule commitment and expectation of \"you will always show up at a given time for a specified duration\" stability that comes with that, then gig work seems like a major step down and even a cynical plot by corporations to deprive you of something you think you should rightfully have. But when what you want is gig work and all of the flexibility that comes with that, and there are many people who want this and have wanted it for years - even decades before the so-called gig economy became a buzzword- then gig work is perfect and irreplaceable.There are some niches that have operated under the gig work model for almost 100 years, such a certain sectors of trucking where drivers own their own rigs and specifically choose to enter that line of work, as opposed to a salaried job where they don&#x27;t have to worry about maintaining their own vehicle, precisely because they want the ability to simply switch their (very well-paid 6 figure minimun) job off like a light when they feel like it, for a couple of weeks or a couple of months or longer, and then switch it back on.I personally know a guy who has performed with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra for almost 20 years doing exactly this. he&#x27;s a trucker with his own rig and his own schedule on his own terms for 6 months out of the year, and tours with the orchestra for the other 6 months. This type of lifestyle would not be possible if there was no established gig system available for people who wished to have that flexibility. reply granzymes 7 hours agorootparentprevMore likely, as a college student the OP wouldn’t have been able to get a shift scheduled because Uber would prioritize drivers who can work full time. reply qbasic_forever 7 hours agorootparentAnd Uber would have a terrible time finding employees in a university area where most of the local population and workforce is beholden to a part time class schedule. It would leave them open for a competitor who values and works with part time workers to swoop in and eat Uber&#x27;s lunch. reply vasco 4 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re so sure about how to create a better business that all the employees would prefer why don&#x27;t you do it instead of speaking about things you clearly don&#x27;t know about?You&#x27;ve been told multiple time people value flexibility and yet you keep fixating on an old work model that you want to apply to everyone. More options are better. Full time jobs didn&#x27;t go away. This whole industry didn&#x27;t exist other than getting paid per shift as a pizza delivery driver.How many gig workers do you personally know? I know more than 20 and all of them prefer gig work to signing up for a full time delivery position at a restaurant.Gig work is available to immigrants super fast as well. Go to any major city in Europe and see migrants and refugees making a living delivering food. Do you think they are dumb and choose the worst job they can get?Talk to some people before you pontificate over what they should want for themselves. They can literally stop the app at any point so your problem isn&#x27;t that gig work exists, but that other people value things you don&#x27;t. reply ffhhttt 4 hours agorootparentprevThere is no way these part time workers would ever have as much flexibility as they have under the current model though. reply komali2 5 hours agorootparentprevOr, we discover that we can&#x27;t really have on-demand food delivery without a level of human suffering we find unacceptable, and it goes away.

Let’s just forbid everything that it’s different from your lifestyle. reply koopuluri 8 hours agorootparentprevI definitely see the argument to classify workers as a more \"permanent\" status and guarantee all the benefits that come with that. But that would likely increase prices, decrease demand and cause some drivers to lose jobs.Ofc, this depends on the region (country, state, etc.), I&#x27;d love to see some estimates on how much prices would go up in a particular region, and how much the demand would potentially decrease - when classifying drivers as full &#x2F; part time workers.Will be keeping an eye on this Seattle experiment. reply arrosenberg 7 hours agorootparent> But that would likely increase prices, decrease demand and cause some drivers to lose jobs.In California Uber and Lyft rammed through a proposition to enable them to continue their labor abuses. Anecdotally, the prices have gone through the roof and I&#x27;ve never had more trouble getting rides, so I don&#x27;t believe that.

I know my wife and her friends hated taking taxis as they were much more likely to be sexually harassed or deal with some strange person. Uber isn’t perfect but it has significantly reduced this since the people who do it get kicked off the app.A lot of complaints i see on HN are very first world and don’t see how much some of these companies actually help. reply lll-o-lll 2 hours agorootparent> A lot of complaints i see on HN are very first world and don’t see how much some of these companies actually help.These companies are not set up as charities. If they happen to help people, that’s a side affect of the primary purpose - generate maximum revenue.Regulation is required where a businesses incentives do not align with societies (mining is an easy example). As much as C level execs will argue, self regulation has never been an effective mechanism. So Uber is incentivised, naturally, to provide a safe experience for a rider, as to do otherwise would reduce revenue. They are not incentivised to provide their drivers any semblance of a “life worth living”, as it has no positive correlation to revenue. This isn’t out of malice, it’s just economics at work. If we, as a society, want a better standard of living for gig workers, then regulation, flawed as it is, is the only mechanism I know of that has some chance of working. reply arrosenberg 4 hours agorootparentprevThey spent $200M, the most expensive political campaign in CA history.

In a sense, executive pay comes straight out of shareholders&#x27; pockets, so they would clearly have an incentive to decrease it, if they could.Executive pay seems fairly independent of the issue at hand. reply anticensor 6 hours agorootparentSome executives are themselves shareholders and want to pay themselves twice. reply eru 6 hours agorootparentYes, but in that case it doesn&#x27;t matter, a dollar is a dollar and they can&#x27;t make extra dollars this way. reply themitigating 4 hours agorootparentprevAre you asking why executives aren&#x27;t decreasing their own pay? reply komali2 5 hours agorootparentprev> If they could just decrease executive pay, why aren&#x27;t they doing that already?Counterpoint: if they could extract more profit from the market by increasing prices, why haven&#x27;t they done so already?Market determines viable price for service, not cost. If the cost of doing business can&#x27;t find a balance at rates the market will pay at acceptable profit margin, the business simply doesn&#x27;t exist. Many aspects of our lives suffer from this reality: renewable energy companies in many places survives only because they&#x27;re propped up by government subsidy.The answer to \"why aren&#x27;t the executives cutting pay\" is obvious: it&#x27;s up to the executives, and why on earth would they cut their own pay, when they could instead simply decrease worker conditions and cut cost of labor? Without a union, executives have literally all the power.Executive pay + shareholder profits (through stock buybacks, dividends) are where all the massive margins go to right now. There&#x27;s no more profit to extract from the market (unless the finance team is terrible at their jobs and have been leaving money on the table) so that&#x27;s where the money to cover increased cost of labor needs to come from.I&#x27;m not really upset at the idea of CEOs making less money, I don&#x27;t get what the big deal is. reply ffhhttt 4 hours agorootparent> and why on earth would they cut their own paySo market set the pay for services however executive pay is not affected by the market at all?Uber pays its executives what it does because other comparable companies pay the same.

But that ability seems like quickly and universally degrades to \"we own you and your schedule\" attitude by ubers of the world reply anyfoo 8 hours agoparentProbably everyone who has used a Taxi in Germany in the past can tell you how professional, knowledgeable, and safe Taxis were there, and that came through very strong regulations.Getting a taxi concession was no joke. You literally had to study on the layout of the city. And given that those are European cities, there is no grid system. You also had to know about safety and take first aid courses.Additionally, taxis require special inspection on top of the rigid inspections necessary for cars in Germany (you wouldn’t want to endanger people with a rust bucket on the autobahn). So yes, they were exceptionally safe.Taxis are mostly Mercedes in Germany, as traditionally Mercedes had the most experience with taxis, and the proper programs in place for taxi use. When I see a Mercedes E wagon on a freeway, I still think \"taxi\" (like some think police car when they see a Crown Victoria).Source: There was a time where I took a taxi almost every day in Germany, and a close family member owns a German taxi concession for many decades now.Lyft+Uber are an absolute joke in comparison.(I talk mostly in the past tense, because I haven’t lived in Germany for long now.

In my experience, Uber is still a bit cheaper than the taxis I&#x27;ve hired and a better experience.I find it hard to believe that most people find Uber to be a equal or worse experience that they&#x27;re paying \"dramatically more\" for, but still buy it anyway. It&#x27;s also not as if the Taxi companies aren&#x27;t taking home the bulk of the profits in the old system. It&#x27;s bad all the way around. reply jmckib 7 hours agorootparentprevYes, Uber drivers are constantly canceling rides or just sitting in one spot until I’m forced to cancel myself and then dispute the charge. Thankfully Lyft still exists, I’ve switched to them and haven’t looked back. I can get to where I need to go much faster and more reliably, at roughly the same price or often less. reply edgyquant 8 hours agoparentprevYes because Uber didn’t have to actually compete with taxis. They offered a nicer service at a cheap cost and both of these things were an illusion. The price was subsidized and the drivers weren’t required (at the time) to meet any of the regulations that apply to drivers or third party passengers (for good reasons.)So they replaced one crappy service with another that has a better UX. All other benefits seem to have vanished when forced to actually make money and we’ve seen a ton of rationale for the existing regulations in the process. Similar to Airbnb reply noirbot 8 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t disagree with most of that, and I generally try not to use Uber or Lyft these days, but \"replace a crappy service with a crappy service with better UX\" is... not a bad business model. Almost every time I&#x27;ve taken a normal cab, the car was worse than every Uber I&#x27;ve ever been in, they tried to bully me into paying cash, and half of the time there was a screen in the car showing me ads non-stop, and it still cost more.I had essentially sworn off of taxis, or even visiting cities where I would need to get a taxi. For all of their supposed regulation, there was almost no other industry I wanted to interact with less.Uber had a really low bar to clear, and even at increased prices, I&#x27;m unsure if it would drive me back to cabs. reply lr4444lr 8 hours agorootparentprevSurprising to some, perhaps, but the average Uber ride did not end in violence or a vehicular accident injuring people that had to be prevented by regulation. To the dismay perhaps of taxi&#x2F;limousine commissioners, the average driver was a relatively decent human being who - given the preexisting apparatus in place to license drivers - did a good job, and cared about his car and his rating on the app to continue to do so. What happened for decades in cities like New York where taxi medallions were so expensive you could retire on their sale was big tech disrupting a dysfunction at its best. As for the cost, I didn&#x27;t lose any sleep at night worrying that I was subsidized by Saudi Royal Family money. When the prices went up, it was never at a rate much worse than a cab. reply jeremyjh 8 hours agorootparent> ride did not end in violence or a vehicular accident injuring peopleThat is not why registries and medallions existed. The point of it was to prevent a race to the bottom that crowded the streets with empty taxis all honking at each other. reply techsupporter 7 hours agorootparent> race to the bottom that crowded the streets with empty taxis all honking at each otherWhich is, to your point, exactly what has happened with Ubers and Lyfts in Seattle.In any popular neighborhood on any popular evening, public transport becomes even more difficult to use because Uber and Lyft drivers absolutely do not respect bus lanes or bus stops. They turn, even more than they already are, into fare pickup zones for these private companies. If a bus driver does manage to make it close enough to honk but far enough to not pick up someone safely, the gig worker does not do anything.I&#x27;m starting to see this at the new train station that opened on the north end of Seattle. There is a \"kiss and ride\" area and it is routinely covered up with people driving vehicles festooned with the logos of the app companies. Some have even figured out that, apparently, they can get even better ratings by dropping their fares off at the bus stops in the bus-only lanes.Meanwhile, there&#x27;s nothing any of us can do because there is no public registry or complaint process for the public to gripe about app gig workers, and if you ask for one you are pilloried as wanting to \"take away good pay from hard-working immigrants\" or some other trope. reply 331c8c71 6 hours agorootparentAutomated fines for driving on bus lanes was already done at scale in Moscow more than 10 years ago.

But a lot of the licensing regulations seem designed to enforce artificial scarcity and restrict competition. The medallion system in NYC comes to mind. The value of an NYC medallion was insane pre Uber, there&#x27;s no good reason for that.Some of the licensing was clearly regulatory capture by existing taxi companies. reply seanmcdirmid 7 hours agorootparentprev> Yes because Uber didn’t have to actually compete with taxis.Taxis in many cities were&#x2F;are horrible, Uber is a godsend in cities like Manila where the option is to (a) get ripped off (for sure) by a taxi or (b) use the Uber app and don&#x27;t get ripped off.

You will have a very difficult time fighting through the gauntlet of adtech and dark patterns, you might have a hard time getting a fair deal. Do people really get fair pricing getting a hotel, a plane ticket, a rental car, a tow truck or an emergency plumber anymore? reply kelnos 3 hours agoparentprevIt depends on where you live, of course.Pre-Uber, I would use taxis when visiting NYC all the time. It was fine; taxis were all over the place, and hailing one was easy. Hotels and some higher-end restaurants would even help line one up for you. Drivers were all over the map, though: some were quiet, some loud, some annoying, some offensive. Most drivers drove aggressively. Some cars were clean, some dirty. The credit card machine was usually \"broken\" (wink, wink). No good way to get any of this feedback acted on.In SF (where I&#x27;ve lived since pre-Uber times), taxis were useless. There was pretty much nowhere in the city where you could reliably flag one down. You could call a dispatcher, but the standard answer was \"a taxi will pick you up in 20 minutes\", and then at least half the time they&#x27;d never show up. The rest of the time it&#x27;d take at least twice that amount of time.So I walked or took transit when I had the extra time in my schedule, or I drove. Which sucked in many ways, as parking is annoying in SF, and if I&#x27;m going out to drink, it means either carefully controlling how much I drink, and leaving some buffer time at the end of the night to sober up, or leaving my car wherever it is, and hoping I don&#x27;t get a parking ticket in the morning (a hope that failed often enough to get expensive).Nowadays I still walk or take transit as much as possible, but I hardly ever drive in the city. Uber&#x2F;Lyft have completely filled this void. As much as their business practices have been terrible, there&#x27;s nothing else that fills their niche.> So I&#x27;m all for company like Uber to be able to cut such bad actors very fast to be able to provide good service for customers.The problem with this is that there&#x27;s no due process. Some disgruntled rider can be an asshole and rate a driver with 1 star, with a comment about feeling unsafe, and that&#x27;s it, even if the driver didn&#x27;t do anything wrong. How is that fair? reply devjab 5 hours agoparentprevIn Denmark we sort of made it illegal for gig drivers, not for food delivery (unfortunately) but what the “scare” did to taxis was it made them get the same Apps that Uber has.So now taking a taxi comes with most of the benefits of having Uber, while also having all the benefits that come with the rather highly regulated industry of taxi services.I guess it’s more expensive, but then, does Uber make money?

Part of the benefits of a service like Uber is having a lot of people willing and able to drive to&#x2F;from places all over. If they&#x27;re rejecting more people and increasing cost due to more thorough screening, the service likely gets worse and costs more, which means less people use it, so less people want to drive for it, and that starts to spiral.I&#x27;m willing to believe that outcome may be better in the abstract, since I&#x27;m not a big fan of Uber in the first place, but it&#x27;s not clear that the average user of Uber wants that trade. reply polygamous_bat 8 hours agorootparentSee: slippery slope fallacy [0][0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slippery_slope reply noirbot 8 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a fallacy to accept the parent&#x27;s premise that Uber should be screening more people out of being hired by them, which then necessarily leads to less people driving for them, and that that would reduce the availability of the service. Making the service less available doesn&#x27;t tend to increase usage of it.Pointing out that Decision A will likely lead to Outcome B, which may in turn cause Outcome C doesn&#x27;t automatically mean it&#x27;s a fallacy.

That&#x27;s the premise of my original post. More screening leading to less drivers feels like it&#x27;s not a \"may\" in this case, since the original post was essentially saying that there were undesirable people who had gotten through current screening and should be driving.From there, sure, it&#x27;s unclear if less \"better\" drivers are a business positive, but either way, that&#x27;s an interesting discussion worth more than just \"haha you did a fallacy\". Claiming that it&#x27;s likely that having less drivers that are \"higher quality\", whatever that means, will improve the service overall is just as much of a guess as what I put forward.Either way, to go back to my original post, it&#x27;s unclear to me that the users of the service are, on average, that upset about the quality of their drivers. The alternative is taxis, which certainly aren&#x27;t better on average at screening their drivers for anti-social behavior in my experiences. reply whimsicalism 6 hours agorootparentprevNothing about what the parent commentator said is fallacious and leaning on pattern identification -> fallacy doesn’t really work because we are not making formal logic arguments. reply TrackerFF 8 hours agoparentprevMaybe the gig economy is a failed model?
