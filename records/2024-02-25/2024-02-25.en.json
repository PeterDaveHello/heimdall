    "originBody": "How Google helped destroy adoption of RSS feeds August 14, 2023 Although RSS feeds are alive and still heavily used today, their level of adoption has suffered because of how difficult a handful of popular technology companies have made it to use them. Google, especially, has relied on the open web RSS protocol to gain so much market share and influence, but continues to engage in behavior that exploits the open web at the expense of its users. As a result, Google has single-handedly contributed to the reason many users who once relied on RSS feeds have stopped using them. Below, we dive deeper into Google's track record of what appears to be an Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish model. The company has continuously built and extended their products around the free and open RSS protocol to gain user trust, only to then remove RSS support once they've locked users in, and ignore any complaints or requests to restore it. Not only is it a blatant disregard for RSS and a huge disappointment to those who use it, it poses one of the biggest threats to the freedom and openness of the internet. Google removes RSS button from Chrome browser Early versions of Chromium (on which the Google Chrome browser is based) once came with RSS integration baked in. The browser had a built-in RSS button that would display in the browser location bar when any website you're on had an RSS feed available. Clicking the button would then take you to the RSS feed for that web page, allowing a user to easily subscribe. RSS subscribe icon in the toolbar of Google Chromium Then, the RSS button disappeared without notice, and no reason was given for its removal. Google acquires FeedBurner and limits RSS In 2007, Google acquired FeedBurner, an RSS feed service that allows website owners to monetize their RSS feeds. FeedBurner works by replacing ordinary RSS feeds with private ones that only Google owns. The feeds are modified to include advertisements, affiliate links, and other tracking mechanisms like read counts, click-through rates and subscriber counts. The feeds are then used by FeedBurner users to track their readers and monetize from their behavior. Google FeedBurner dashboard After acquiring FeedBurner, Google shut down FeedBurner APIs in October 2012, which prevented developers from creating third-party RSS integrations to the service. Then, in July 2022, Google drastically changed FeedBurner's infrastructure and operation model by removing most of the FeedBurner services that its RSS users depended on, which included email subscriptions. This left many people with non-working RSS feed URLs in their subscription emails with no way to fix them. Google shuts down Google Reader Back in 2005, Google created Google Reader, a web-based RSS Reader application. It allowed you to add RSS feeds anywhere on the internet, organize them into folders in a clean, minimalistic interface. Then in 2013, after years of users relying on it for their RSS feeds, Google killed it. Google Reader dashboard after the shutdown announcement The reason Google gave for axing Google Reader was in an announcement where they claimed that \"while the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined\". But an engineer, who worked for Google at the time, said \"it felt like the entire time I was on the project, various people were trying to kill it.\" Nevertheless, Google's allegation of low usage didn't instill a lot of user confidence in the viability of RSS feeds. Users were left with no RSS reader application, no comparable alternative, and no education from Google on how to continue using their RSS feeds without Google Reader. This led users to not only discontinue using Google Reader, but abandon RSS feeds altogether. Google removes RSS from Google Alerts Google Alerts is a service offered by Google that will notify you with an alert when there is new content on the web that matches a search term you specify. In October 2008, Google added the ability to receive Google Alerts in an RSS feed. But, in July 2013, Google decided to remove it, making email the only option to receive Google Alerts. A reason for the removal wasn't clear, but the big, yellow banner on the top of every users' Google Alert dashboard was. A screenshot of the Google Alerts dashboard with a banner communicating that Google Reader RSS feeds can no longer be used and must be changed to email delivery Eventually, after receiving backlash, Google reinstated the RSS feeds for Google Alerts. But by this time, many users already abandoned RSS feeds due to Google's shut down of Google Reader (mentioned above), so the damage was already done. Google kills its RSS browser extension Google provided a Google Chrome extension that places a small RSS icon next to a website's URL in the browser bar if you're on a web page that has an RSS feed. Google's RSS browser extension in Chrome Web Store Despite this extension being used, Google removed it. But then, after backlash, reinstated it within a week afterward, claiming it was removed by mistake. And while reinstating it was better than not, removing it was still a blow to user confidence in RSS feed usage overall. And if it's true that it was done unintentionally, it still shows how little of a priority RSS has become to Google, despite how much RSS has contributed to the company's growth. Google removes RSS integration from Google News In 2002, Google announced Google News, the company's first media aggregation site, with the ability to add RSS feed URLs from all over the web. The dashboard of Google News mobile app Then, after many RSS users were locked in and relying on the Google News app for their RSS feeds, Google deprecated RSS support, causing users' RSS feeds to stop working. Then, Google shut down its RSS feed support entirely in December 2017. The company gave no reason for killing off support for RSS feeds in its Google News app. As a result, users had no choice but to find alternative RSS links for each feed they added to the Google News app, while proprietary Google News links continued to work fine. Google's still at it... The most recent incident was in May 2021, where Google announced they're working on an update to Google Chrome that brings back RSS support. But there has been no word on an official launch since it was announced years ago. It's unclear of what the implications of this feature will be. But it's clear that Google has a history of building products with RSS and killing the RSS support once it's established a user base. So there's no guarantee that, even if the feature launches, it'll continue to be available and reliable to RSS users over time. Because Google undoubtedly has a tremendous amount of influence, we hope that it understands incorporating RSS features into their products and then removing them negatively impacts user perception and confidence around RSS overall. RSS feeds are a vital part of the open web. So, If Google should decide to continue integrating RSS features in its products, it's critical that Google will support them, maintain them over time, and ensure they always remain a priority. ❤ Open RSS is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit headquartered in the District of Columbia, USA and funded only by voluntary donations of its users.

But I am not looking forward to when that changes, I like getting my news in a timeline manner from exactly who I want. One part of the article bothers me a bit: > Users were left with no RSS reader application, no comparable alternative, and no education from Google on how to continue using their RSS feeds without Google Reader. This led users to not only discontinue using Google Reader, but abandon RSS feeds altogether. I may be misremembering but didn't Feedly step up very quickly? Even offering the ability to easily migrate everything over. I continue to use Feedly today and it has been great. Maybe I just didn't really notice since I have always used a third party app on iPhone (Reeder) so I just repointed the app from Google Reader to Feedly and it was basically as if nothing happened. Don't get me wrong them shutting it down was the start of me distancing myself from Google services. But I feel like there was very much an alternative that seemed to advertise fairly heavily on migration. Or am I misremembering the timeline a bit? reply blihp 14 hours agoparentYes, there were 2-3 other (mostly web-based) services that stepped in with Feedly being the main one. However, by that time the popular client-side tools had been pretty much been wiped out due to years of Google's free offering. For some of us, that's what killed the user-facing RSS market. (I was so fed up I ended up cobbling together my own solution... far from anything polished but I'm happier with it than I was with any of the offerings available at the time) reply dsaravel 11 hours agorootparentI went years without consuming RSS until I discovered Fraidy Cat[1] here at Hacker News. 1. https://fraidyc.at reply jskherman 5 hours agorootparentThis actually looks a better paradigm than the firehose of RSS feeds (even if grouped by tags/categories). Thank you for sharing this. reply grigio 10 hours agorootparentprevme too but i came back with yarr reader https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr reply boraoztunc 4 hours agorootparentprevPerfect! Thank you. reply freeAgent 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I was a huge fan of FeedDemon at the time. Unfortunately, it was updated to be primarily a local Google Reader client and lost many users to Google Reader itself. Development stopped around the time Reader was canceled. I ended up switching to Newsblur and have been using it ever since through (mostly) the web interface. I've switched to Mac/iOS since then as well and have tried out NetNewsWire and Reeder. Both are excellent and sync with Newsblur, but neither support Newsblur's social features, which are important to me. I love being able to read others' comments, leave my own, and receive replies from a community of folks who are all committed enough to RSS as a medium to keep at it. I find it provides a significant amount of value. It also aids in discovery of new blogs/sites that I've ended up following directly over the years. reply nerdjon 13 hours agorootparentprevI never looked at clients other than the Reeder app (not google reader), but that is iOS and Mac only. Even supports local pulling (not sure if it always did though, never thought to check until now). I imagine that didn't help Google's situation either. Here I was using their servers and never going to the website except to do the occasional subscription modification. reply wyclif 4 hours agorootparentI still use NetNewsWire. reply puttycat 14 hours agoparentprevFeedly is indeed great, I just wish they'd stop trying to add AI and automated topic highlighting which clearly doesn't work. reply maxglute 3 hours agorootparentIt works alright, and TBH it's time RSS readers moved PAST google reader and add more useful features. Deduplciation, AI summarization etc. Stuff that helps manage RSS for those with lots of feeds, as one is likely to accumulate over time. reply jseliger 14 hours agorootparentprevI just wish they'd stop trying to add AI and automated topic highlighting which clearly doesn't work. A bunch of companies are also doing or attempting to do AI and automated trial finding for clinical trials, and that's not working either: https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/please-be-dying-but-not-.... Fortunately, the stakes are low, since patients who don't find the right clinical trial for cancers will only die. reply orzig 11 hours agorootparentDo you think the solution is better software, or is real blocker on the business/policy/cultural/incentives side? Inspired by that series I looked into building a better front end for clinical trials.gov but after seeing a few organizations try similar approaches without (yet) nailing it, I became convinced that I’d become one more classic naive-technologist story. But have the existing approaches really missed a low hanging solution, even if it’s partial and maybe impossible to monetize? reply nerdjon 14 hours agorootparentprevFeedly seems like a company that is trying anything that will stick to get people to subscribe without getting rid of their free offering. Their free plan is likely enough for most people. I know for me none of those features matter. Especially since I just never log into Feedly themselves. I just use the Reeder app as my frontend and have gone a couple years without logging in. I also just don't change my actual feeds much. reply IgorPartola 12 hours agorootparentThis is a great example of a business built on what should not really be a business. There are certain types of things that are fundamental to the internet, and trying to sell a premium version of that is always an uphill battle. Imagine that in 2024 I tried to sell you a web browser. One that maybe has a slightly cleaner UI or some fancy plugin system but ultimately is just a plain old browser. Maybe some very small percentage of people would pay for it, but most are entirely happy with the free and FOSS choices available since the core features of a browser are standard. RSS by all means should be similar: just like ping, cat, sh, browsers, email clients, video players, etc. the core features are well defined and an open source project should be the default choice. If you want something fancy or proprietary then sure you should be free to pay for it. But I can’t imagine wanting to build a company that pays salaries around any of this. There are situations where a person or a team of 2-3 can make a lifestyle business out of selling something that I have seen referred to as “legacy software” (this doesn’t mean old, but rather fundamental and “boring”, aka the Linux kernel). But Feedly competes with its own free product and cannot see the forest for the trees. reply heresie-dabord 10 hours agorootparent> RSS by all means should be similar: just like ping, cat, sh, I must say that reading an RSS feed is as simple as this: wget \"myURL\" -O -python3 -c ' import sys import xml.etree.ElementTree as et tree = et.fromstring(sys.stdin.read()) for el in tree.findall(\"./channel/item\"): print(el.find(\"title\").text)' But the other applications that you mention are not simple applications: > browsers, email clients, video players, etc. the core features are well defined and an open source project should be the default choice. [1] _ Sample URL: \"https://www.tomshardware.com/feeds/all\" reply mtrower 7 hours agorootparentHonestly I struggle to think of a more complicated program than a modern browser that expects to fully support the existing web. reply nerdjon 8 hours agorootparentprevWhile I get where you are going with open source project being the default choice, I don't think it fits the example here. Feedly, like Google Reader, for me is nothing but a server. It's the same reason I pay for my email, iCloud, and similar services. I am paying for them to store data, run some service, or similar for me. Even if I went the open source route I would still want a server that is doing the fetching for me. A central place to keep things in sync between multiple devices and to cut down on the data usage when on my phone. That server costs money to run. Either I am running that server myself (and taking on the Maintence of it) or I pay a service like Feedly. While I agree that Feedly's way of monetization is likely wrong when they could have just run the route of $5 a month and that's it. Nothing fancy, it fetches and thats it. That could be a perfectly sustainable business model. Edit: Also I really think we should re-examine \"open source should be the default\" when the vast majority of open source projects are not at the polish of something like Chromium. Most average (non technical) consumers are not really going to accept what a lot of open source's experience is. See gimp and open office compared to Photoshop and Microsoft Office. reply jonathankoren 7 hours agorootparentprevThe wild thing is, that’s almost exactly what Netscape was doing back in mid and late 90s. I think the commercial versions (ie the one you bought in a box at Babbage’s or Electronic Boutique), had an HTML editor, and some more integrated file types. I don’t really remember. I never bought it, because the free beta version was enough. reply smsm42 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah their AI efforts are weird. It's like they are ashamed of \"just\" making an excellent product for rss, and want to do something special but nothing useful, at least for me, came out of it do far. TBH, I'm ok with them just being an excellent rss reader and will keep paying for it. reply nirav72 14 hours agorootparentI think they're adding lot of these features as incentives to entice users to switch to their subscription service. Not sure what percentage of their users pay for the subscription. reply smsm42 13 hours agorootparentI actually signed up for AI enabled plan out of curiosity (I had non AI subscription for years prior). Had to downgrade back because it was too annoying and I couldn't figure out how to make it stop completely. Whoever inside the company is pushing this is not doing them a service. reply stanislavb 14 hours agorootparentprevHave you tried Lenna.io? I’d guess no, but it could regard some of the pains. (Disclosure - a product I work on) reply stavros 10 hours agorootparentI'd guess no too, since there's no site at that domain. reply cbovis 14 hours agoparentprevFeedbin filled the void for me and have been a subscriber ever since. Can't believe it's been ten years. Hoping that the developer made bank. reply yellow_postit 11 hours agorootparentFor me it’s been NewsBlur — every time I get the itch to find a new reader I decide it’s not worth the hassle of learning a new UI. reply stavros 10 hours agorootparentNewsBlur user here too. I just want something that's as close to Google Reader as possible, and that's it. reply trauco 11 hours agorootparentprevFeedbin is so great. Easy filtering, can process newsletters, etc etc. Very reasonably price. Highly recommended. reply glenstein 10 hours agoparentprev> may be misremembering but didn't Feedly step up very quickly? Even offering the ability to easily migrate everything over. I remember the same thing as you, so I think that's correct. But I would say Feedly probably only recouped some single digit percentage of Google readers users. But then there were however many other users who had their relationship with RSS forever fractured from the shutdown of Google reader, and the absence of a smooth off-ramp certainly contributed. I also think that having the credibility of Google behind RSS contributed to people being comfortable with them, not unlike iPods helping lead to the adoption of podcasts. I shudder to think whether podcasts would even have gotten off the ground without people being socialized into accepting them through the connection to an Apple product. And while I'm not an Apple fan I'm forever grateful for the long term impact on how we consume content. So I would say the long and short of it is that Feedly helped, but I suspect it was perhaps an order of magnitude smaller in terms of its role as a positive force for RSS than Google. reply thaumasiotes 9 hours agorootparent> not unlike iPods helping lead to the adoption of podcasts. Podcasts are named after the iPod, because that's who the audience was. They are radio shows that are recorded and then made available for download; other than the usual lack of melody, they are identical to other mp3 files. Spoken-word musical albums and books on tape were already well-established phenomena before the iPod existed. What's the difference supposed to be? reply glenstein 8 hours agorootparentThe difference is in achieving the mass adoption of podcasting as a fully mainstream distribution medium. With podcasts, we now have an entire universe of media distribution that happens via an open protocol that is not controlled by any one company, which is a miracle. There was no guarantee that it would turn out that way, and, as we see with RSS, or now with Activitypub, it's more than a small struggle to get anyone to care about open protocols for their own sake. It takes a moment that is ripe for it, a simple enough experience, and some sort of cultural signal that it's \"for everyone\" in a sense. That was my point. I am perfectly aware that audio can be distributed in other forms. reply mtrower 7 hours agorootparentProbably, they are like me, meaning we seem not to be on the same page as you regarding the term 'podcast'. To me, a podcast is just an audio talk session, mastered and distributed as a digital audio file. That's it. Distribution can take many forms, but the podcast is the file. 10 or so minutes of google-based research seems to offer support to this notion. > universe of media distribution that happens via an open protocol that is not controlled by any one company What is this protocol that you speak of? Searching \"podcast protocol\" leads to absolutely no useful links on the subject. Podcasts in my experience are distributed in one of three ways: * Download links on a web page * Embedded streaming links on a web page * An RSS feed That last (RSS) could be considered a \"protocol\" of sorts, I suppose. At the very least it's what I would expect a podcast app to support. But you then go on to refer to RSS as a separate entity from your \"podcast protocol\", so I'm back to being confused as to what you might be talking about. What is this open protocol that is intrinsic to your definition of 'podcast'? reply glenstein 4 hours agorootparentRSS can be considered a syndication protocol, or a 'standard' if you want to be strict with the term protocol, but nothing about those distinctions is pertinent to the point I was making. Podcast can refer both to individual episodes or to the series of episodes, neither usage is more correct than the other, it's your responsibility to interpret words in good faith in the context in which they're used. And again, nothing about this distinction is pertinent to the point I was making. RSS is not the same thing as podcasts, because while generally all podcast feeds are distributed via RSS/Atom, they aren't necessarily, and moreover not all RSS feeds are podcasts. And again, nothing about this distinction is pertinent to the point I was making. To reiterate, Apple, with the iPod, was instrumental in elevating podcasts to a mainstream medium of content distribution. It's by analogy to this that I make the point that Google could have played a similar role in facilitating the mass adoption of RSS. I'm not interested in any further exploration of the conceptual differences between RSS and podcasts unless you believe it has an upshot that's relevant to the original point I was making. reply thaumasiotes 22 minutes agorootparent> RSS is not the same thing as podcasts Well, yeah. Not only is it not the same thing, the concepts aren't related in any way. A podcast is an audio file. RSS is a format for publishing the information that you've updated your website. >>> With podcasts, we now have an entire universe of media distribution that happens via an open protocol that is not controlled by any one company, which is a miracle. We had that before podcasts. You go to a web page, and you download a file. The protocol is called \"HTTP\", the HyperText Transfer Protocol. Where do podcasts come into this? reply Telemakhos 9 hours agoparentprevThere were plenty of RSS readers. Many browsers had them built in: Mozilla called them \"Live Bookmarks\" and even Safari once had an RSS reader. I used apps like Reeder and ReadKit and loved them, but my favorite apps were probably newsboat and newsbeuter (CLI RSS readers; newsbeuter goes back to 2007). It's like people forgot that non-web-interface rss readers existed. I still use some RSS reader apps to keep up with various sites I care about. Also, remember that ever podcast is also an RSS feed. reply mtrower 6 hours agorootparent> It's like people forgot that non-web-interface rss readers existed. I'd wager that a lot of people never even knew these existed. To a lot of people, the browser became (or simply always was) the only real interface to everything internet related (or for some people, just about everything period). reply sinanisler 14 hours agoparentprevthanks to WordPress reply smsm42 14 hours agoparentprevNot only Feedly. When greader was shut down, there was at least half dozen other apps, some of which were pretty good. I liked feedly the most so I never checked the rest but I know they weren't unique. reply salamanderman 14 hours agoparentprevMy recollection when trying to find a Google Reader alternative was that there was no free alternative. Everything at the time that I found had been a premium alternative to Reader before it shut down. reply nerdjon 14 hours agorootparentFeedly is free depending on how many feeds you need. But that is likely part of why reader shut down. Depending on how often it's pulling and how often you are reading, that isn't free to run. Especially if you don't even use their app to read your feeds, you may never be able to see an ad. Would rather pay for it personally so I know it's there. reply vdaea 13 hours agorootparentPaying does not guarantee anything. It does not guarantee a more reliable service, it does not guarantee that they will hear you out when they change a feature or the design, ruining it, and it does not guarantee it won't shut down tomorrow. They will refund you, and you will have your money back, but you will have no service, and you will be back in square one. reply nerdjon 13 hours agorootparentI mean... sure. Even paid services eventually shut down. But I have far more confidence in something at least making sense for the company to keep running if it is something I pay for vs something that is just given away for free. If I am relying on an online service, while paying for it doesn't guarantee it being up it's a safer bet than a free one. reply gitonup 14 hours agorootparentprevI haven't used it in a while but https://theoldreader.com/ seemed like a fairly drop-in replacement for Google Reader. reply Uhhrrr 3 hours agorootparentI still use it daily. It is a decent substitute. reply TheKarateKid 12 hours agorootparentprevYour mentality of expecting everything to be free is why there are no alternatives, and also why Google Reader shut down. Building and maintaining these services isn't free, so when people don't want to pay for it there's no incentive to actually make or maintain such service. reply nerdjon 8 hours agorootparentRight. Even if we want to say that it could take a one time deployment and it can just sit there forever (which, it can't. it needs security updates and similar). The server itself isn't free. Sure if they are smart if multiple people are subscribed to the same feed it only fetches once, but just the constant fetching would eat up resources. Then storing that data, you retrieving it yourself, etc. reply albert180 10 hours agorootparentprevAn RSS Reader is really a technical miracle, requiring lots of maintenance and development effort.

Other rss readers were either much different (think cards design, or too much whitespace everywhere, or whatever), or they had premium plans they were telling you about all the time, or they had premium plans and a low limit of rss feeds you could add, or they had no mobile apps, or the mobile apps required premium, or whatever. Nothing was like google reader: free, information-dense, and reliable. When google reader was killed, rss died for me. reply glenstein 10 hours agorootparentRight, I think you've hit the essence of the issue here. Those alternatives were definitely there, but there's an order of magnitude difference between them and Google in terms of what they did for the normalization of RSS as a way of consuming content. Saying Google stopped supporting RSS but at least there's a boutique alternative, I think is kind of saying well Coca-Cola shut down but at least there's Soda Stream. Not wrong, but it misses the point that there's a global embeddedness that was left behind. reply gmurphy 8 hours agoprevI designed Chrome, and was responsible for decisions around its UI, including the addition and removal of the RSS button. Our design philosophy at the time, which was in reaction to the bloated I-need-engagement-for-my-team browser UIs of the time, was to only offer what people needed, and allow extensions to cover everything else. I loved RSS. We all did. I still use Feedly every day and mourn the loss of Google Reader. But even back then, practically no-one else cared, even amongst our early adopter userbase. If we had lowered our usage bar to allow the RSS button, the bar would've been low enough that a thousand other features-you-don't-want-but-other-people-do would've been in there too (omg the arguments about having a \"print\" button). Extensions was our \"if you want it, you can add it\" answer. It was imperfect, because it didn't allow ideas such as RSS to be advertised to the mainstream, but we had already clearly seen that that hadn't worked, and regardless, your daily tools should not be a place for pushing agendas unless you have total confidence that they will be valued. I still think \"following stuff\" is an unsolved, undervalued problem and big opportunity space reply sirspacey 5 hours agoparentThis is something those of us who grew up with the Internet don’t want to face. Whether by nature, nurture, or some other force - user agency lives in the very long tail of any software usage. In every category, agency drives the birth of tech but dies in the scoreboards. Every product I’ve loved, every founder I’ve believed in, was about human possibility & creativity. But the ones lucky enough to scale to species level adoption discover that the ethos of creation is lost in the swarm of consumption. Perhaps I’ve arrived at a poor conclusion, but I’ve simply decided to accept that I am a fairly unusual person for wanting to craft, make choices, and discover the weird, wonderful, or just discover what I didn’t know there was to discover. I’ve weened myself off of consumption over the years. Here’s to making all my future decisions in tech about putting my attention, energy, and thought into “what do I want to create? learn?” I don’t think the product universe I live in will ever be dominant. But I do believe it can exist if we accept that we can either build it or trade it, but we cannot do both. reply gmurphy 5 hours agorootparentI don't think you are alone here - there's a reason Chrome invested so heavily in dev tools and made them (and things like view-source) accessible in the core distribution even though they were also perfect candidiates for being addons. Many of us owed our careers to the path that view source opened, and we wanted to pay it forward. I do regret not finding ways to do more - for example, an unrealized goal of mine was to find a way to add a 'create' button to Chrome to nudge everyone to be a creator - my favorite simple+cheeky idea was to have a way to enable contentEditable on the current site, then save the resulting changes as an extension you could give to your friends, allowing you to graffiti the internet in private small groups. reply AlexanderTheGr8 4 hours agorootparentprevUnrelated but you are a great writer! \"user agency lives in the very long tail of any software usage\" \"agency drives the birth of tech but dies in the scoreboards\" \"scale to species level adoption discover that the ethos of creation is lost in the swarm of consumption\" You remind me of the writing of Antonio Garcia Martinez in the book Chaos Monkeys. reply leobg 2 hours agorootparentprevQuite a Nietzschean insight. Both in therms of its direction and the quality of its expression in language. I am bowing to you, Sir. reply smusamashah 7 hours agoparentprevUnlike other browsers at the time, why was it decided not to even read RSS xml files and show them like a nice page like other browsers? Even now RSS shows up as raw xml. Edit: reread your comment. I guess it was because this could be done using an extension. I believe this to be the main reason for lowering adoption / use of RSS with rise of chrome. To this date chrome shows raw xml when you open RSS xml while other browsers give you something interesting and readable to look at and even let you subscribe to that interesting page. reply gmurphy 4 hours agorootparentUnfortunately I don't remember the exact reason, but with some squinting at the past I believe it would've come down to two things - resources and how we thought about the role of developers: Chrome was a no-crunch 50-person project, which sounds like a lot until you think about how we were porting webkit to windows, adding a sandbox, creating a new javascript engine, a new windows UI toolkit, etc and we were ruthless about prioritization - any engineer who could've spent on an RSS renderer would've been taken away from valuable webkit windows compatibility work (omg ACID tests), and weeks mattered. Second, we had an extremely strong belief in letting developers own as much as they could - our impossible ideal was that the Chrome UI wouldn't exist and developers would just create content you could access emphemerally through your operating system. At the time, we had seen that it was possible for developers to use various trickery (XSLT or CSS?) to style RSS feeds so they would show up somewhat like how you described (IIRC Feedburner did this) So if you take those two things together (and again I may be misremembering) you see it being a \"developers can do it so if they care they can do it, we should not spend time making something that overrules them\" It's not possible for me to know whether that was the right idea in hindsight because I don't know what we would've sacrificed (I think I would've preferred using that time to make the standalone image renderer have better zooming/panning controls) reply rossjudson 6 hours agoparentprevThis is the reference answer, direct from the source. Much appreciated. Sorry that you have to put up with speculative nonsense from the willfully misinformed. reply mattparmett 8 hours agoparentprevYour comment made me curious, were there any other features or ideas that you (& team) loved but didn’t have the user base or buy-in to include by default? reply gmurphy 7 hours agorootparentThank you for taking me down memory lane with this great question. It's been almost twenty years, so I may misremember the internal popularity of many things, but one that stands out was browsing history - almost everyone that joined the team for the first ten years wanted to redesign history and felt it could've been a huge differentiator. We had mockups that looked like subway maps, implemented floating overlays showing your recent tasks, and we designed the history database to store everything forever. In reality, Google search was good enough to find what you wanted 95% of the time, and most people would not bother discovering and learning a separate pathway to find the remaining 5% - especially when combined with our poor human memories and local search capabilities at the time. reply makeitdouble 6 hours agoparentprev> But even back then, practically no-one else cared, even amongst our early adopter userbase This reminds me of chapter support in podcast players. For a very long time the every player dev was arguing that nobody cares. And it took years for the tune to become \"nobody cares except germans\". Then it was implemented for a \"vocal ninority\", and now everyone gets chapter support and I don't think any user is lamenting about the evolution. This is one of the worst aspect of the \"nobody I know cares about it\" mindset (I don't think we can really work around it, but it should be acknowledged and kept in mind). The other path is to push for many more places building their own tools and services, so they don;t even have to ask for these changes and do it themselves, with everyone else getting to enjoy the result. Basically, while Google was the reason Chrome existed in the first place, I think it's also the main liability to have a product designed with a global audience in mind. PS: the issue with chrome extensions for core behaviors is they'll always be second class citizens. I'm still happy there's an escape hatch though. And also thank you for your work on the browser, I don't want the tone of this to be overly negative when it's really about side points. reply BeetleB 14 hours agoprevAs someone who never relied on Google for RSS, this article comes across as somewhat nonsensical. Most Google Reader users were not using RSS before and likely would never have used them if not for Reader. They didn't kill RSS - they introduced people to it. As someone who used a self hosted reader as well as a standalone desktop reader, the coming and going of Reader went completely unnoticed. Ditto with browser support. Even Firefox dropped it - and they're the browser that introduced the feature! Seems silly to blame Google for the general trend. Couldn't care less for Feedburner's attempt to monetize it. RSS is a protocol like email. Would I think positively about a service trying to monetize email? The rest of the article is about various Google services dropping support for it. If Google kills Gmail would we say Google killed email? It's a nonsensical thought process. Anecdotally I found it was Twitter that killed RSS. When it was new people were using it for the same purpose I was using RSS. To follow people and organizations. reply expazl 12 hours agoparent> They didn't kill RSS - they introduced people to it. For myself and most people i knew that knew of RSS feeds, we weren't introduced by google reader, we migrated to it because it was a great reader. Then once they had everyone onboard reader and there weren't really anyone competing becuause reader was great and universilly liked, they killed it, striking a gigantic blow to RSS in general. It really just is not a case of google just \"bringing people in then letting them go\". They did the equivalent of offering free hamburgers at the corner between Burger King and McDonalds and then shutting it down after the two chains had gone bankrupt. And you might say \"Sure, but people still enjoy fast food!\" and that's true, but after that it's not burgers people are buying, it's burritos, because the burger market becomes a wasteland when someone does something like that. reply glenstein 10 hours agorootparent>For myself and most people i knew that knew of RSS feeds, we weren't introduced by google reader, we migrated to it because it was a great reader. Right, this is exactly my experience as well. I used all manner of desktop based RSS readers before Google reader appeared on the scene and became my mainstay. I also think it's not wrong to note that Google Reader introduced a lot of people to RSS. But I don't think it follows that shutting down Google Reader was merely a net neutral impact on RSS. I guess I just don't follow the logic of, well Google elevated RSS, therefore there's no problem with shutting it down in the grand scheme of things. Shutting down Google Reader rolled back progress that had been achieved by Google Reader itself, but the fact that the RSS ecosystem had recentered itself around Google's offerings and integrations also made the shutdown uniquely damaging. reply BeetleB 11 hours agorootparentprev> Then once they had everyone onboard reader and there weren't really anyone competing There may not have been profit driven companies competing and that detail is mostly irrelevant. There was no shortage of alternatives like software running on your computer and self hosting options. RSS wasn't designed to help companies make money. The demise of Google's competitors is irrelevant to the long term health of RSS. It was thriving before such companies tried to make money off of it. People who didn't use Google Reader were not at all impacted by its demise. The RSS experience remained the same. It's silly to claim Google played a role in killing it. reply glenstein 10 hours agorootparentGoogle Reader was the predominant offering, and they integrated RSS into practically everything. The RSS ecosystem had Google as its center of gravity due to Google's strategy of embracing it. Shutting it down did a unique damage that only Google would be capable of doing. There are indeed desktop alternatives, but I guess the critical question is whether you believe losing any one of them would have an equivalent impact on RSS that losing Google Reader did. I think the main point at stake is that Google had a disproportionate role, and so it's perfectly true that RSS lives on and I'm grateful for that, but I don't think any other software, or company, or website, has had such a disproportionate role both in elevating and in rolling back RSS. reply earthwalker99 12 hours agorootparentprevYour analogy leaves out the fact that RSS doesn't work for serving ads, which is why all of this was in Google's interest. reply nordsieck 11 hours agorootparent> Your analogy leaves out the fact that RSS doesn't work for serving ads, which is why all of this was in Google's interest.

Although I suppose the point your making is that these forms of ads wouldn't be something that Google necessarily could control or monetize. reply crazygringo 12 hours agoparentprevAgreed. The article is explicitly presenting it as if Google had some grand strategy to \"embrace, extend, and extinguish\". But the far simpler and more plausible interpretation is that it just wasn't popular enough to support. Outside of some hard-core tech people and some journalists, almost nobody used RSS. And so it's equally plausible to write this story as: Google believed in RSS -- they brought it into Chrome, they launched Reader, they acquired FeedBurner, but the user numbers just never materialized. So they shut them down because Google mostly only maintains projects and features with large numbers of users. I think you're right that, more than anything, Twitter killed RSS. But maybe it's more accurate to say algorithmic feeds in general -- including the Facebook news feed, Google News, and Reddit as well. I simply don't see a world where RSS would have become broadly successful if Google had made different choices. Especially with such a super-open standard as RSS, Google is simply not responsible for the death of RSS. Even if you still haven't forgiven them for killing Reader. ;) reply glenstein 10 hours agorootparentI think the iPod played a critical role in normalizing podcasts as a globally accepted form of content consumption. And I actually don't think RSS was too far behind. There is more in the way of development and integration that could have continued to normalize RSS, And I suspect it wasn't a specific reaction to the benefits of RSS, so much as it was the company's mobilization behind Google Plus, that led to their strategic pivot. That core passionate user base that believed in and used the product, I believe was in fact the critical alchemy that was missing from Google+, which by comparison was soulless and pushed by strategic considerations rather than organic iteration on user feedback or response to user needs. Articles have been written about this before, but I absolutely believe in the right circumstances Google could have successfully built out a social network, but it was Google Reader in fact was becoming one. I think Google correctly assessed that there was redundancy between Google Reader and Google Plus, but they just chose the wrong path. reply rossjudson 6 hours agorootparentprevThe article is a fanciful mixture of paranoid lego-duplo block imaginings, with a slab of boredom used for fuel.

To me telegram is the best RSS reader app (guess on could also use any other chat like Matrix that supports bots). Manybot or other bots do the translation easily. You get instant preview and syncing between multiple reader devices for free. If you want you can add reactions and comments. News outlets have taken this path already officially. I believe that those interfaces are simply the future of feed syndication. IMHO it does not make too much sense to build dedicated apps or web services for syndication.

The best quality sources are always involving thorough human vetting of trusted and impartial people on platforms which have higher bar to entry and require some friction to find, aka word of mouth.

You don't know the signal-to-noise ratio of each feed for you. You subscribe to tens or hundreds of feeds and, boom, you have another problem - how do you prioritize which feed to read . With https://linklonk.com I'm trying to solve both problems: discovering feeds to follow and prioritizing content from all feeds. You start with content you liked - submit links you liked and you will get connected to all feeds that included this link. For example, there are a bunch of feeds that included this link https://simonwillison.net/2024/Feb/21/gemini-pro-video/ Those are: - https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/ - the original blog - https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed/ - a feed of \"small web\" links, I didn't know it existed, but one of the users must have submitted this feed. - https://hnrss.org/newest?points=1000&count=100 - HN links that got more than 1000 points - https://lobste.rs/rss - submissions to Lobste.rs - https://lobste.rs/t/ai.rss - submissions to Lobste.rs with \"ai\" tag. The point is, if you upvote this link on LinkLonk (https://linklonk.com/item/481037215144673280), you automatically get subscribed to all of these feeds. This is a way to discover new feeds through content you liked. Now, being connected to hundreds or thousands of feeds might seem crazy. But we have a solution to that which also relies on what content you \"liked\". LinkLonk knows how often you liked content from each feed you are connected to (which is essentially the signal-to-noise ratio). So it ranks new content based on that. If you like 50% of posts from https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/ then new posts from Simon Willison will be shown above other links from, say, https://lobste.rs/rss. The more you like - the better the ranking of fresh content becomes. In this world you don't have to actively manage which feeds you are subscribed to or not. You only rate content. reply asciimov 12 hours agoparentprev> I believe the internet has gone full-circle… One of the most annoying things about the internet is avoiding the great enshittification cycle.

I wasn't at Google during the reader shutdown, but after being here at 8 years, I now understand why things shut down so often. Google has a lot of shared infra and they are always doing forced migrations and various unfunded mandates. Depending on the stack, maintaining a project at Google takes 0.5-3 people (like if a UI toolkit is turned down, you have to migrate). Plus there are infra costs. On top of that, being on maintenance for a project like Reader, it's probably not very good for your career trajectory. The adverse effects of always going for launching/landing destroyed so much at Google. Many engineers would love to just help maintain software like that, it just doesn't tend to work out given the incentive structures. (Plus that headcount and infra has to be attributed to some team.

They don't need it to fingerprint people by forcing them to sign in -- Google has enough other priorities like Search, YouTube, Chrome, for that. Making Gmail available for free to consumers, along with Docs and Drive, isn't something to drive ad sales. It's to get everybody used to the products and liking them, so that businesses choose them instead of MS. Google has successfully turned themselves into the main alternative to MS Office with this strategy. When it comes to Gmail, Docs and Drive, Google's making their money \"honestly\" -- not through ads but through paid corporate subscriptions, and a smattering of consumer ones (like extra storage). reply TheRealPomax 14 hours agorootparentprevThis raises questions (that you probably can't answer, but still) about why Google doesn't have a \"maintenance subsidiary\" playbook, where instead of killing a project off, they spin it off, with a bucket of cash to last that project 3 years, after which they'll have to have figured out their own monetization plan (or open source transition) while still having access to everything Google because it'd just be another Alphabet-owned company. Not every engineer wants to live the fast-paced \"create and move on\" life, there are so many skilled engineers who would happily take the lower salary, but also lower-pressure, maintenance jobs.

They could help people out a bit by open-sourcing the web front-end, but that’s substantial work and you’re still a long way from having a working clone of the product. EDIT: I see I misread your comment and you’re talking about keeping it on Google infra but separating it for accounting purposes. It’s an interesting idea but I don’t see why it would fundamentally change the viability of the product. Also, there’s an ongoing maintenance cost to having more products on shared infra. If you’re the team that runs the global distributed relational db (for example), or maintains the C++ discrete optimization library, it’s much simpler to support two products that make a billion each rather than 2,000 subtly different use-cases each making a million each. Not to mention costs incurred by non-engineering departments (marketing, accounting, legal). reply TheRealPomax 11 hours agorootparentNot just separated for accounting purposes: literally make it a new company under the Alphabet umbrella (spinning up an LLC is basically a Tuesday afternoon for Alphabet) and then seeing if, as its own entity with an Alphabet \"series A\" grant, it can keep the product alive or not.

I self host my blog but when Ghost1 was deprecated I failed to do the maintenance needed to move to Ghost2, and the site has kind of stagnated for me. It doesn’t take much effort but I have so many things, and administering servers is not really how I’d like to spend my time. The mastodon server I signed up to is getting slow and inconsistent. I’ve thought of self hosting, but it’s the same concern. I administer a digital ocean droplet with discourse for a work forum. One day, maybe after a normal apt software upgrade, it disappeared from the web. I could only access it via the web SSH panel. Something went horribly wrong on network config. I spent a long time trying to rectify it, and finally moved to a backup from the week before. Then software upgrade was fine. I believe in open source. I run Linux, use Kdenlive for video editing, Inkscape, Gimp, everything I can that is open. My whole life is committed to my own open source project.

Often the first paragraph of an article is the intro so I had no idea if the article would be interesting. It killed my ability to quickly skim a bunch of articles. I understand why the providers did it — they need the clicks to survive. So I’d say Google did kill RSS but it had nothing to do with Reader and everything to do with the click based ad model they made the de facto standard. reply crabmusket 9 hours agoparentIt's frustrating that the balance of providing enough content to gauge interest of often not struck. I follow some personal blogs which have title-only feeds which I do think reduces my click through rate significantly. I follow a few niche news sites which post essentially a long descriptive title, which is workable. The best balance I've seen for non-full-post feeds was Guardian Australia which posted a fairly decent introductory paragraph to their feed, enough for me to gauge whether to click in. Annoyingly though news organisations seem to be bad at properly tagging their posts, so I stopped using RSS with large mainstream news sites as the firehouse was too much. reply alisonatwork 4 hours agoparentprevThis is the answer. RSS without the full article is just Twitter. If you need to click through to an ad-ridden or paywalled website to read the content, then you might as well have just visited the website in the first place. The primary benefit of RSS from my perspective was being able to fetch news while online and then read it offline. That implies being able to consume information without obtrusive tracking and popups and marketing gimmicks. Once RSS feeds just became their own marketing gimmick, a way to hook you back into the site's ad-driven ecosystem, they lost their utility. Mailing lists are now the better alternative, although Substack is rapidly killing that medium too by consolidating every provider onto a single platform so they can correlate subscriptions, hijack img and href tags, and track every open and click. reply metalrain 15 hours agoprevPeople reading articles from RSS are not using Google search or Google browser, not being monetized by Google Ads.

Google and Facebook make most of its money off ads because the reality is that users don't like paying for stuff directly. reply pdimitar 8 hours agorootparentI am a bit skeptical that they don't try to monetize Premium users as well -- I mean invisibly, by selling our viewing history, timing of when we watch stuff etc. But I can't do anything about that and I openly admit all my efforts to block YouTube ads on an iPhone have failed so I eventually gave up and just bought Premium. And to be fair, I don't regret it, because I have another consideration -- I can easily get some nice Xiaomi phone and root it and install various blockers and alternative YouTube frontends...

I think this is evidence that RSS has fundamental usability issues that prevent it from going mainstream. Google realized this ages ago and ditched it. reply plagiat0r 3 hours agoparentBack in the day, there were desktop RSS readers in many forms, and a paid new browser, Opera 7.0 ($10, I still have my license somewhere) with built in RSS reader and email client, and torrent client, among other things... However, the problem was a missing synchronisation of readed entries between your home and office PC. Mobile device was not a thing back then but slowly started main stream adoption. I mean, very few had smartphones. Google reader was revolutionary, solving this exact problem for free and mobile app quickly followed. It caused almost all offline RSS readers to decay and starve to death. And then few years passed by, and this is the moment they pull the rug, but the damage was done. Luckily, Feedly and others quickly emerged, and smartphones were a thing. Also, some self hosted RSS readers came to existence and get polished. reply olliej 13 hours agoparentprevNo, what we're saying is google made a free service that was accessible everywhere, which meant all the non-google options essentially died off (commercial paid apps were competing with free, non-commercial ones were competing with \"synchronized everywhere\" which means paying for some cloud system). Then once the rss ecosystem had been largely wiped out, google killed reader. Sure you could migrate your data out, but to where? It took time for replacements to get to maturity, and they lacked syncing or financial backing that made them free. It was _possible_ to get an alternative, but the overwhelming majority of people are not really able to deal with the immediately available alternatives, and by the time the RSS ecosystem had redeveloped usable software the majority of the people who had been using reader/RSS were no longer going to switch back because they'd migrated to other systems. The cheaper/free service to drive competitors out of business model is a tool monopolists use all the time because it is effective. In this case google did exactly the same thing, honestly I don't think out of malice, and then realized that they couldn't make a profit of it and so killed the service. But fundamentally their actions were the same as the monopolists, and had the same impact, so when they shut down reader they basically ended rss for the vast majority of users. For example, NetNewsWire was a good piece of paid commercial software which I used for years, that was essentially killed by reader because they simply couldn't afford to develop or support it when the major competitor was free. NNW is now free and OSS, but that was after the IP became functionally worthless and the company that had bought it simply returned it to Brent Simmons (the original author). reply phailhaus 5 hours agorootparentSo Google made a free service, and when it was gone, everyone realized they weren't willing to pay for it. Because it wasn't valuable to them.

Still usable now for free. I feel sure there were others but would have to look them up. reply suddenclarity 11 hours agorootparentiOS and OS X had Reeder back then, which used Google Reader as an engine and then released a new version that stored the data locally. That's how I primarily used Google Reader back then because the user experience was so good. For other platforms, five-year-old Feedly was very mature and the platform I'm using today since I left Apple (Feedly Classic to be specific since they made their \"new\" app awful). To summarize, yes. There were plenty of mature alternatives and a migration was easily done by exporting and importing a file. Feedly supposedly got 3 million new users in the two weeks that followed Google's shutdown. A far bigger issue than Google shutting down was the fact that people had moved on to Facebook and Twitter while newspapers created closed ecosystems with their own apps. Jason Kottke, then one of the world's most popular blogs, declared blogs to be dead. reply olliej 6 hours agorootparentprevThe issue isn't \"are the available now\", it's were they practically available at the time reader was killed. At the time reader was killed there were a plethora of okay-ish options, but most were new, or lacked the usability polish, or lacked the perfect syncing of reader. As a result when it was killed for the majority of users there were no practical alternatives: new projects weren't an option for most users because they lacked the usability polish, and obviously a brand new project with few users doesn't instill a sense it won't go away shortly (especially given the context). Plenty of apps existed but many of them used reader for syncing (womp womp), and those that didn't required you pay or required you have some other paid service for syncing, and still because they were apps you couldn't just use them wherever you were (plenty of work computers limit software installation etc), browser based ones require you use the same browser everywhere (and required you to not use chrome because it doesn't have integrated rss, and so you run into the chrome monoculture of web devs forcing use of chrome, and corporate software installation limits preventing firefox), and plenty of the OSS ones required you literally run your own server (which is what I've been doing for years), or rely on random 3rd parties who may or may not be able to afford a free service indefinitely. (holy run on sentence batman) The result of this was when reader shutdown the overwhelming majority of users simply stopped using rss, presumably even if they did export their subscriptions they've long since lost them, and built up habits around non-rss based mechanisms. Hence rss (for anything other than podcasts) ceased being relevant for the overwhelming majority of people. I'm trying to make it clear here, the issue isn't that using RSS became impossible, it's that by making reader free google decimated the rss reader ecosystem such that when they killed reader there simply weren't practical alternatives for the majority of users of google reader. As a result reader being killed changed the general habits of those users to no longer use rss feeds for information, and given by that time things like twitter provided similar services (most blogging platforms have a \"post updates to twitter\") they had no real reason to go back to rss readers. So the basic argument for reader making rss become irrelevant for general blogging, etc was: 1. RSS comes into existence 2. Apps start being made to subscribe to rss 3. People start using those apps 4. Google introduces Reader, which is free 5. Paid apps fromcan't compete with free so either die or adopt in app ads (which at the time reader didn't have) so people move to reader 6. Non-google rss readers don't have syncing, so people move to reader 7. Non-google rss readers either require people pay, or use specific paid services, to get syncing, so people move to reader. Or they use google reader as their back end so their users can now trivially just start using reader anyway. 8. At this point there are no major alternatives to google reader, it makes up the overwhelming majority of all people using rss, as a result the few stand alone readers that still exist are for niche use cases or are unpolished hobby projects that come and go over time 9. Blogging platforms introduce tools to allow posts to blogs to automatically post updates to twitter, Facebook, etc 10. Google kills reader 11. The free rss readers that still exist all use reader for syncing, so lose syncing, and have to either charge money or require users adopt paid syncing tools, so people don't migrate to them. The projects that come into existence at this point are too rough for general users so they don't bother, and at this point they don't need to as the autoposting frommeans that they don't need it. I think that's a fairly fair assessment of what happened. But I think there's a big caveat to be addressed though. Google reader was far and away the most popular RSS reader, like overwhelmingly so, prior to it existing the market of RSS readers was something where a few people could earn some money, but it was not really a significant market. So my question is, absent google reader would RSS feeds ever have become as popular as they were during the period reader was available?

The way that XML rendered was controlled by the browser. This all sounds like Google apologism. reply iLoveOncall 15 hours agorootparentRSS was already dead long before Chrome was the market leader. And even if the feed was rendered properly, it's essentially useless without an associated extension or website to aggregate those feeds. reply redwall_hp 15 hours agorootparentprevThe funny thing is...non-Google browsers had even done that. Chrome was the odd one that didn't, and Firefox was still more popular at the time. Firefox had Live Bookmarks, which I used for a long time. You'd just drag the icon to your bookmarks toolbar and then it would appear as a folder containing all of the entries as clickable bookmarks to the relevant web pages. The browser alerted you to autodiscovered feeds as well. The orange RSS pictogram (not the initialization) would appear right there in the URL bar if the site was set up right. As early as OS X 10.4, desktop Safari had a built in RSS reader as well. You'd open the sidebar that's currently mostly used for the reading list and bookmarks, and there was some way to add the current page's discovered RSS feed with a button click or two. It also rendered feed XML in a particularly nice way that looked like a very clean looking blog, so landing on an XML page wouldn't intimidate less technical users. Chrome deliberately was dysfunctional, and it taking over probably had more to do with RSS not growing more mainstream (as well as the rise of social networks and over commercialization) than Google Reader shutting down. reply aulin 15 hours agoparentprevThat's not even remotely what happened. UX was bad because RSS was barely tolerated in the ad-driven web that was being established. No one had any interest in evolving the UI. reply hot_gril 14 hours agorootparentApple tried. RSS was shoved into every part of OS X at the time, and users were still confused about what it even is. reply iLoveOncall 14 hours agorootparentprevThat would be a compelling argument if the RSS button had never been added to websites in the first place. The UI and UX was left entirely to the website administrator, not big tech, and even websites that did not have any monetization did not improve the experience for users. And of course adtech could have invested in RSS to make it financially attractive. But they didn't, cause nobody uses it. reply Zak 13 hours agoparentprevI had hoped that as more people grew up with computers, the share of sophisticated users who would adopt technologies with higher inherent complexity would increase. I'm disappointed the opposite has happened. If popular browsers had embraced RSS enthusiastically, it might have taken off with mainstream users. There's nothing about the protocol that makes it difficult to provide a well-integrated experience.

    "originLink": "https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html",
    "originBody": "ARCHITECTURE.md Feb 6, 2021 If you maintain an open-source project in the range of 10k-200k lines of code, I strongly encourage you to add an ARCHITECTURE document next to README and CONTRIBUTING. Before going into the details of why and how, I want to emphasize that this is not another “docs are good, write more docs” advice. I am pretty sloppy about documentation, and, e.g., I often use just “simplify” as a commit message. Nonetheless, I feel strongly about the issue, even to the point of pestering you :-) I have experience with both contributing to and maintaining open-source projects. One of the lessons I’ve learned is that the biggest difference between an occasional contributor and a core developer lies in the knowledge about the physical architecture of the project. Roughly, it takes 2x more time to write a patch if you are unfamiliar with the project, but it takes 10x more time to figure out where you should change the code. This difference might be hard to perceive if you’ve been working with the project for a while. If I am new to a code base, I read each file as a sequence of logical chunks specified in some pseudo-random order. If I’ve made significant contributions before, the perception is quite different. I have a mental map of the code in my head, so I no longer read sequentially. Instead, I just jump to where the thing should be, and, if it is not there, I move it. One’s mental map is the source of truth. I find the ARCHITECTURE file to be a low-effort high-leverage way to bridge this gap. As the name suggests, this file should describe the high-level architecture of the project. Keep it short: every recurring contributor will have to read it. Additionally, the shorter it is, the less likely it will be invalidated by some future change. This is the main rule of thumb for ARCHITECTURE — only specify things that are unlikely to frequently change. Don’t try to keep it synchronized with code. Instead, revisit it a couple of times a year. Start with a bird’s eye overview of the problem being solved. Then, specify a more-or-less detailed codemap. Describe coarse-grained modules and how they relate to each other. The codemap should answer “where’s the thing that does X?”. It should also answer “what does the thing that I am looking at do?”. Avoid going into details of how each module works, pull this into separate documents or (better) inline documentation. A codemap is a map of a country, not an atlas of maps of its states. Use this as a chance to reflect on the project structure. Are the things you want to put near each other in the codemap adjacent when you run tree .? Do name important files, modules, and types. Do not directly link them (links go stale). Instead, encourage the reader to use symbol search to find the mentioned entities by name. This doesn’t require maintenance and will help to discover related, similarly named things. Explicitly call-out architectural invariants. Often, important invariants are expressed as an absence of something, and it’s pretty hard to divine that from reading the code. Think about a common example from web development: nothing in the model layer specifically doesn’t depend on the views. Point out boundaries between layers and systems as well. A boundary implicitly contains information about the implementation of the system behind it. It even constrains all possible implementations. But finding a boundary by just randomly looking at the code is hard — good boundaries have measure zero. After finishing the codemap, add a separate section on cross-cutting concerns. A good example of ARCHITECTURE document is this one from rust-analyzer: architecture.md. This post is a part of One Hundred Thousand Lines of Rust series.",

But most of these documents are just short for any of these, \"I want to try this new architecture/technology because it's fun, my colleague at a FAANG uses it, I've read the BOOK, and it looks good on my CV\".

Open source projects don't have an employee's first day, so they don't have this introduction. They're not good if you don't have a sea of time, though. (An employee is expected to take a few weeks before getting anything done on their own.) I'm a security consultant, so we get to see a brand new one of these every two weeks and the problem with these explanations is that they are ad-hoc, unstructured, and mention lots of irrelevant details because the speaker has the curse of knowledge. Perhaps someone new to the repository should write this thing once, after which it can just be maintained. Second best is to just have anybody write it down, taking a minute to think about what goes in there and what doesn't rather than doing it always on the fly, because as the author says: > this file should describe the high-level architecture of the project.

I agree with this. A map of the code is great. It's like an exploded-view drawing of a mechanical component. It helps highlight what goes where and connects how to what. ...but is this what \"architecture\" means? I was under the impression that architecture went beyond major-units-and-their-interfaces and had more to do with the decisions and assumptions that lead to those specific units and interfaces -- the why behind the what. In other words, the \"architecture\", in my view, is the thing we might go against when we refactor things. Not because names and interfaces change, but because the rationale for having things a certain way might still apply only we don't know about it because those assumptions and decisions -- the architecture -- is rarely documented and still would not be under this proposal. reply tarcon 2 hours agoprevI think that's just more documentation to read which becomes outdated (read: lies) at the point in time someone moves code around with refactoring tooling in their IDE.

There are definitely many projects where you don't need to understand every single aspect of the codebase to be able to contribute a meaningful fix or even a feature.

Give the core idea, any communication points (sockets, apis etc), maybe an abstract diagram. reply o11c 6 hours agoprevOne particular aspect of project architecture I often see people do wrong: a failure to have clear dependency structure between directories (and, often, too much stuff within a directory). This is particularly common if there is a directory named something like \"common\", \"util\", or \"misc\" (I am not actually arguing against having such directories, only noting they are prone to confusion). I developed the following rules, which can be automatically enforced if you explicitly write the ranks (don't try implicit ranking; that means you won't get sane errors when you violate the rules): 0. Every directory has an implicit dependency on all its contained children. 1. A directory that does not depend on any other directories has rank 0. It suffices to only use rank between sibling directories, and it's probably simplest to maintain, though global ranking does work. 2. A directory that depends on others has a rank of 1 + the highest rank among its dependencies. To ease refactoring you could loosen this to \"has a rank that is strictly greater than the highest rank among its dependencies\". 3. Thus, circular dependencies between directories are forbidden; refactor (preferably, by splitting directories; most projects are too merged already) until you have a DAG. (circular dependencies between files in a single directory are allowed, subject to language-specific caution) 4. Thus, it is forbidden for a subdirectory to depend on a parent (or ancestor). If you encounter this, move the relevant files to a new subdirectory (since depending on a sibling or uncle is okay; if rank only applies between siblings this means the parent has to add a dependency on the uncle so that it gets the correct rank). 5. Depending on a cousin (or nephew) directory should be treated as a dependency on that cousin's parent, though (depending on what amount of directory structure your language forces you to use) it may be a hint you're doing something wrong. 6. Each directory can produce at most one library (shared and static count as the same library) or executable (at least, user-facing ones; code generators and tests might not count). Note that for other reasons it's generally inadvisable to ship multiple shared libraries or multiple static libraries, though you might use them during development. 7. (YMMV) If a directory contains any generated files (or their inputs), it should not contain any other files. Note that there are at least 3 major workflows for generated files, so the details will vary, but isolating them is useful regardless. Note again: this is both coarser and finer than build dependencies - we treat directories as units, but add conceptual dependencies. As a general rule, I find it useful to define that the client (which calls `connect`) depends on the server (which calls `listen` and `accept`), and/or the data consumer depends on the data producer. Admittedly I have not deeply considered the case of servers that are worker-like, but note that it is often still possible to satisfy both by splitting directories further. Note that additionally defining a \"weight\" (1 + weight of dependencies), although possible, is not particularly useful at the directory level. Long chains are easier to understand than tangled messes, but have a higher weight, and we don't want to discourage splitting a directory into a chain. ===== In my experience, a project of about 100 kLoC organized itself about 20 immediate subdirectories of src/ with a max rank of about 10. This was roughly follows: 0-1: core support for the language, compiler, and replacements for the standard library; these almost never change. If somehow you have other kinds of code that doesn't depend on these, consider artificially inflating their rank to at least 2. About 1 each. 2-3: most fairly-project-agnostic (but not polyfill-like) \"common\"-like directories. About 2-3 each, probably. 4-6: semi-project-specific common stuff, most executables/libraries. IME generated files tend to belong here, and may be responsible for splitting a directory into a chain of length 3. There are a lot of these, usually with 1-2 dependencies of the previous rank and several more of the rank before that; likely there is nothing that depends on the entirety of any previous rank. 7-9: dependencies of the most complicated executable. About 1 each, a single chain at this point, though they might still have low-rank dependencies. At this point there's a decent chance that a directory might depend on the entirety of rank 2. 10: the most complicated executable (at least for me, this was the executable that had a conceptual dependency on other executables, even if it didn't have a source dependency. If you have a simple executable that conceptually depends on a complicated one, the simple one would be the highest rank instead). Note that only one of its dependencies is a 9; the rest are in the 3-6 range. An alternate structure with deeper nesting, which I considered but never bothered to implement: src/base/ - the directories ranked 0-1 above src/lib/ - everything that either is part of a shared library, or is used by multiple executables (all directories ranked 2-3, and some ranked 4-6) src/each-executable/various/ - dependencies of a particular executable (including all directories ranked 7-9 above) src/each-executable/main/ or just src/each-executable/ - the file containing `main` and as little else as possible (otherwise we're likely to confuse \"code closely related to `main`\" and \"code that is executable-specific but not involved in many dependencies\") At top level, I never bothered to formalize it, but it was basically a single chain (though exactly what a \"dependency\" is not quite as clear here): 0: scripts/ - executable scripts used during the build that don't have to be built, or that might be installed with no more than a shebang update. 1: src/ - all source code, including that for tests and tool/ 2: tool/ - built executables needed for later parts of the build. Refactoring to split this out from shebang scripts is nice for your sanity, but may be noisy, especially if your build system's dependencies are sloppy. In contrast to build/ these are never cross-compiled. 3: build/ (all other output (data and potentially-cross-compiled code); contains bin/, lib/, and share/ at least) Hopefully, projects that get much bigger than this can be split into further subdirectories so that the dependency ranking only need be done separately within them. I'm not sure if any big project is actually that nice in whole, but you should at least be able to create sanity in part without too much distress. That said, keep in mind that this is just one approach to this particular problem, and it is just one architecture-related problem. Particularly, if your tooling makes it difficult to split directories (or files for that matter), fix your tooling first (related: \"recursive make considered harmful\") reply bbkane 3 hours agoparentVery interesting approach, thanks for taking the time to write it!

Temperatures soared for the globe in January, as several new records for heat were set during the month. The World Meteorological Agency, NASA, NOAA, Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the Japan Meteorological Agency all agree: last month was the hottest month of January ever recorded. Global average temperature anomalies for each January from 1950 to 2024 are plotted here, with each month compared to the 20th century average of 12.2°C Credit: NOAA \"Temperatures were above average throughout the Arctic, most of northeastern North America, central Russia, southern and western Asia, Africa, South America, eastern and southeastern Asia and Australia. Africa and South America saw their warmest Januarys on record,\" says NOAA. Furthermore, according to Copernicus' records, January's global average temperature was 1.66°C warmer than the pre-industrial average for January (from 1851-1900). \"It is the eighth month in a row that is the warmest on record for the respective time of the year.

This leads to new highs with some periodicity. It is not clear for how long this pattern will persist. There is the issue of tipping points in what is a very complex dynamic system (atmosphere, oceans, permafrost, polar regions etc.) The everyday analogy is boiling water in a pot. As we slowly inject heat at the bottom of the pot, the patterns of water motion change a lot as the temperature rises. First some occasional air bubble, then some visible currents, eventually just a chaotic, unstable, mess. Now if only the frogs inside the pot would stop gazing at the gently rising air bubbles and realise that this is not all there is to it, future frogs might be very deeply inconvenienced... reply sunday_serif 2 hours agoprevI try to be an optimist, but the constant stream of record breaking abnormal weather really steers me toward climate doomerism. Do others here feel similarly? Do you think these trends are reversible? Is technology the solution? Something else? I guess my real question is: how do you incorporate all of this change into your worldview and outlook? reply jemmyw 2 hours agoparentI personally believe we're doomed. Even if there is a technological solution, as things get worse it gets harder to deploy it. If people are struggling with persistent climate driven change then they'll be using whatever is cheap and available. I've accepted it though. I don't doomer at people unless they ask. I can't do anything about the situation. I've voted for green parties and politics my whole life. If I have blame it's not for denialists, it's for all those politicians who know and accept the science but did nothing, they didn't have the guts, being voted in again was more important. It does make me sad to see so many HN comments rolling out the same stupid \"I don't trust the data\" arguments that were pretty thoroughly debunked within the scientific community 10 years ago, yet still feel the need to jump on every thread about it because the whole thing makes them so angry. reply roenxi 42 minutes agorootparentIf there is a theory for how climate change will doom us, you should spend time talking about it. The threats people usually bring up are relatively mild. Eg, wet bulb events are pretty scary but are also sound relatively straightforward to mitigate if they start happening. Human societies deal with nasty weather events already. I've heard scenarios put as mild as a reduction in real GDP growth, which is just a non-issue compared to the risks people want to shoulder to mitigate climate change. > I've voted for green parties and politics my whole life These people tend to be anti-nuclear in my experience; so I'm not sure from your comment if that strategy is a good idea.

So yeah, it is terrible but not going to make me depressed by the future so much as the present. They need to figure out economic growth like Asia did. It is their only hope. > stop working outside and install aircon inside I dunno, sounds scalable to me. Repurpose office buildings with air conditioning for crisis use sometimes.

What credentials would satisfy you? Folks with PhDs and political accolades have been speaking the same points for years, and clearly they haven't bread success. Frankly a question to ask is why you feel a person like her isn't encouraged to speak out on these issues, and isn't worth listening to? Is she saying things that aren't true? If so it seems like the thing to do would be to speak to those misstatements. Much more likely though, systemic sexism and ageism make it difficult for folks to accept young women in leadership roles, particularly when their message asks for change from the status quo. So the reasons you should care about what this person is saying are 1) she is speaking truths about climate change 2) the truths are about existential threats to humanity and she is able to communicate the seriousness of those threats 3) she is able to rally groups of like minded people with a common vision of those threats and their seriousness 4) paying attention to her and uplifting her leadership role helps erode systemic sexism and ageism. reply Gud 16 minutes agorootparentAll fair points, but what actionable advice is she offering? reply greysphere 2 minutes agorootparentAppreciate your engagement.

Isn't it, as a general rule, preferable that politicians fear being voted out, and so do the things that the voters want, so they get reelected? The alternative seems to me for a politician to say one thing in the campaign - what the people want to hear, and then do something else when elected - what he thinks is best. Some do that, but they're not loved for it. I am pretty sure that even when or if politicians do not care about the voters, they still do not do the right thing, but some other wrong thing, like enriching themselves. What you are in fact complaining about is that politicians elected by other people did what those people wanted, instead of what you wanted. While not laying the same complaint on those you voted for - greens. They obviously did right to listen to their voters - you and people you agree with. It's not about the guts of a chosen few.

We certainly can have smaller communities where people accept the consequences of their actions, where people will hear about what else happens besides \"more\" when you ask for more. It's not that the human brain floating in a vacuum is incapable of understanding that actions have consequences. We develop that skill pretty early! I think it's interesting to look at what separates these smaller groups from the bigger groups. I don't think it's people themselves being built of a different stuff. It's the inputs and the norms that differ. I can certainly think of norms for a group that result in worse outcomes. I also don't think we're necessarily at an optimum in epistemics, looking around me. So optimistically, candidly, there's room to do somewhat better. reply ako 34 minutes agorootparentprevYes, it would help if we would be more careful with our choices. But it would also be nice if politicians could be held accountable: if they say global warming is fake, and it turns out to be true, they should get some sort of penalty. Same with allowing pollution, you’re responsible for the health impact. If a politician doesn’t think global warming is true, at least be open to the fact they might be wrong and be careful with their choices.

Under the assumption of perfect information, yes. Politicians should be afraid of doing unpopular things that will not get them re-elected. A problem that exists down there, outside the internet bubble of information overload, is that people _aren't_ reliably informed. A human in a vacuum without access to accurate information will never spontaneously guess that they should care about the environment. A politician's decisions are informed by voter preferences. That's good. But the voters, themselves, how should they know whether to care or not care about any particular subject they're not experts in? Who do you trust? Where does information come from? Well, there isn't a widespread decentralized information effort. It's not billions of us independently doing investigatory work. It is a handful of us, a small relative percentage.

Closing down all nuclear plants was first decided on in the year 2000, 24 years ago. It were the Liberals (FDP) and Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) who rescinded that decision in 2010, only to later reinstitute it in panic after the Fukushima meltdown happened. Those reactors that got shuttered hadn't had any safety inspections in years, they had no viable fuel left and not even the owning energy companies wanted to operate them any longer than absolutely necessary, so the reactors would have been shut down even without the Green party in the current government. That the now missing nuclear baseload had to have been replaced with coal, well.. Thank the Christian Democrats for that.

I don't know how or why there would be any optimism about this. reply Alpha3031 33 minutes agoparentprevDACCCS is currently insufficiently mature to estimate how \"reversible\" any specific level of warming is, but current policies are expected to limit warming to 2 to 3 °C by 2100, compared to over 4 °C where no policies were implemented. Net zero emissions by 2050 would even be compatible with 1.5 °C, and that is well within what is achievable with current technology. Plus, with AR6, we have the first estimate of the zero emissions commitment over 50 years, and it is centred around zero, with a 90% CI of roughly ±0.3 °C, meaning it is likely (with \"low confidence\", meaning this is our first time doing it as part of CMIP) that changes in 20 year average temperatures will be quite small after complete cessation of emissions. That means assuming we ended up on a trajectory like 2 °C by 2100, if we wanted to reverse GSAT at least we would have a better than 66% chance of having another 5 decades of research and development and deployment (plus the 7 decades it took to get there), so once we get to zero emissions it becomes much less urgent.

For a few years I was certain I'd never have children. Then I thought life has been hard for most of my ancestors, way harder than it's going to be for my children. Is a hard life still worth living? I now think so, and I have two children. I respect people's choice not to have children (by the way, it's going to make the world easier for my own), but I think for some childfree people, one of the motivations is rooted in the same individualistic values as the values fueling consumerism and the contemporary Western lifestyle.

Should our objectives be not a tad higher than “oh well, life will be worse but at least as a species well still exist”? Also note that while we have only started “writing” since a couple of thousand years, and indeed keeping track for less than that, we do have the natural record. That may not be as precise as the written record, but there is a lot of it over a very long time. That natural record puts boundaries on previous temperatures.

One could scale down many sectors, or more aggressively shift to a greener economy, if it wasn't for the fear of people/voters loosing their jobs. -- So when considering options I think one needs to give smaller weight to salaries (\"somone had to feed that person anyway\") and more weight to natural resource extraction needed...which is the \"real\" cost.

My conscience is perfectly clean. My only advice is that we need to fix the monetary system first or else we'll never be able to escape the cycle of deception. We'll never know what is real or not real or who we can trust or not trust. Once we have a functioning monetary system based on hard money, only then will we be able to see what problems are real and come up with innovations that solve humanity's real problems... Who knows, that might include climate change... Our current political reality is fake and we can never get to the truth while our monetary policies distort incentives. Almost all narratives nowadays are founded on deception and they compete against each other for mindshare... Once they cross a certain threshold, it's too easy for certain narratives to use monetary incentives to reinforce their own propagation; a powerful ecosystem of government organizations develops around the narrative and then private companies follow suit to get their contracts. There are literally no honest narratives even in the running at this point. Once honest people see how the sausage gets made in the centers of power, they lose the heart to push their honest agendas. Only deceptive agendas remain. Today, I'm not even in a position to answer the question of whether or not climate change is real and caused by humans because I cannot trust the current system or the 'experts' in relevant fields to provide me with that information. For all I know, the promoted experts could be 'incentivized' to the eyeballs to lean in a certain direction. I cannot trust them because I cannot trust the system which selected them. I'm an expert in my own field and I've seen how the sausage is made there. If that's how it works in my field, why wouldn't it work the same way in other fields?

I would expect the public to pressure the policy makers in creating policies that reward behaviour that counters the factors that have been identified as causes of the said climate change. Also since humans are messy and imperfect, I'd also expect that these policies are confusing, imperfect sometimes even dishonest. And since humans are humans, these policies will involve shaming other humans to do the right thing, so I'm not at all surprised that a bunch of humans don't like being shamed into doing something, and resist.

I still have a problem with how batteries (and solar panels) are not recycled and how you're getting replacement battery quotes above the price of a brand new EV. That has got to be regulated and changed, otherwise we'll be stuck with single use EVs. reply mupuff1234 1 hour agorootparentprevSure, but you do realize that the majority of companies and economy will not benefit from the transition, quite the opposite? So seems like the bigger financial incentive is to deny the issue if anything. reply wsc981 1 hour agorootparentI agree it will be horrible for the economy. And for food production and the like. Germany is also feeling the pain as the high energy costs make manufacturing companies unprofitable, forcing them to cease operations or move to other countries. But the EU is determined to follow this path and The Netherlands will follow. As a result the middle class will be crushed through high costs of living and taxation. And many companies will cease to exist or move elsewhere. Of course, this will result in rising unemployment. reply leobg 2 hours agoprevWhen you look at the chart, it's odd that the temperature rise started only in the 1980s. Or at least what you can see in the chart. People have been burning wood and coal for centuries. The industrial revolution happened in the 19th century. There were railroads and airplanes. And big industry in the 1950s and 60s. So it's what we are seeing there. Just the delayed reaction toall of that? Or is there something especially grave that happened immediately before the 1980s? reply lucubratory 2 hours agoparentWorld population was 2 billion in 1930, 3 billion in 1960, and 4.5 billion in 1980. Today the world population is a bit under 8 billion. The Earth could easily support many more than 8 billion people with the right technology install base, I don't want to give the impression that population is an issue in itself, it isn't. However, with the predominant technologies being oil-based transportation, coal-based power, and carbon intensive agriculture throughout that period and continuing today, the size of our economy (enabled by the size of our population) is capable of a much greater degree of warming through GHG emissions than we were in the 1960s, let alone the 1800s. reply AlienRobot 1 hour agorootparentThis is such a terrible situation. We need depopulation but every country's economy seems to be based on infinite growth and can't deal with an aging population. I'm scared the best case scenario will end up being \"the world gets so hot it kills enough people to stop getting hotter.\" I don't know a lot about climate change but I don't thing the Earth will simply reset when enough people die, considering the melting ice caps won't just unmelt because of that. reply Tade0 1 hour agorootparentIn terms of population reduction we're actually handling that by ourselves, as the absolute number of births peaked somewhere in 2014-2017 and started declining since. Overall most of the population growth now is younger, larger generations replacing older ones, with the demographic pyramid looking like a sausage being filled with meat. World population will peak by 2086 at ~10.4bln. reply zelphirkalt 7 minutes agorootparentThat's only a prediction, an extrapolation by the UN I believe. Many things can change until then and we don't know anything for sure. Even if it peaks by 2086, the population mass until then, with our current way of living, will have devastated the planet. reply asadotzler 19 minutes agorootparentprevThat's still too many. Sure, it'll probably level, but why not get in front of that and find a good balance today instead of assuming it'll all just sort itself out magically? reply Tade0 2 minutes agorootparentIt is sorting itself out \"magically\". If anything, we don't know what to do with ageing populations. The previous estimate put the population in 2100 at 11bln and growing, but then China had its census, which revealed a very different demographic situation than anticipated and the pandemic happened, upending those projections. Recently also India went below replacement fertility rate - that now makes the two most populous nations having crossed that threshold - also way ahead of previous projections. Estimates of populations of African countries are most likely overstated, just like fertility rates. DoreenMichele 1 hour agorootparentprevI think that would depend a lot on whether depopulation led to rapid restoration of our lost wetlands and I am going to assume no one is making models of that because the wetlands issue gets so little attention generally. reply lisper 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's exactly right. We are taking carbon that was sequestered under ground over a period of hundreds of millions of years and releasing it back into the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. That genie will not go quietly back into the bottle. reply zelphirkalt 5 minutes agorootparentAlthough there are ways to bring it back under the earth: Burry trees deeply underground. Which is of no economic value, but that might be a way, if we dig deep enough and do it on big scales. reply AmericanChopper 1 hour agorootparentprev> We need depopulation but every country's economy seems to be based on infinite growth and can't deal with an aging population. There is no way of organising an economy that will allow it to support having the demographic of net producers significantly outnumbered by the demographic of net consumers. This is an economic problem, but only in the sense that if you want people to have access to good and service then you need people willing and able to produce those goods and services is economic problem. If you have a demographic collapse, then you don’t have that any more, no matter what system of economic management you’re using. The idea that we need depopulation is also about as intellectually and scientifically valid as the voluntary extinction movement is, yet somehow a lot more people seem to think it has some credibility. reply AlienRobot 43 minutes agorootparentThat doesn't seem to make sense because we're talking about how many people produce and consume things, not the rate of which they produce and consume things. We just need the working age populace to produce more than everyone can consume. Automation was supposed to achieve that. In fact, I think it has already achieved that long ago? I'll reword it in a depressing, pragmatic way. We can already produce enough to satisfy the NEEDS of the entire population. So if you only need X jobs to produce for everyone, but extra people are getting born because nobody can just set a limit to how many people are born, then what do these extra people do in their lives? What is going to be their job? If they produced things, it would be a waste of resources, because the needs of the entire world are already satisfied. But that's exactly what they do. Do we really need fancy clothes, and fancy houses, and fancy food, and TV shows and music? Do we need art? We don't really \"need\" them, but we already produce enough that we can afford to have people whose jobs is just making these things. But by this logic we don't really need computers either, you can't eat them, so I guess I'm superfluous as well. I guess the point is, how many of these \"superfluous\" things we should produce? If population goes down, some jobs won't get as many workers as before. I can't really say \"artists are unnecessary, we should just get rid of the entire profession and replace it with Dall-E because it's more productive.\" In fact, I'm not sure there is any job we can just get rid off to state \"we will birth no more people to do that job. It will have 0 workers assigned to it.\" And this is of course just speaking theoretically, assuming you could control births and professions with precision, which we can not in practice. People are going to get born and they will do jobs that aren't as productive as other jobs and there is nothing we can do about it. But to say we can't produce enough doesn't make sense if we can't even define how much is \"enough.\" reply AmericanChopper 21 minutes agorootparent> If they produced things, it would be a waste of resources, because the needs of the entire world are already satisfied. But that's exactly what they do. Do we really need fancy clothes, and fancy houses, and fancy food, and TV shows and music? Do we need art? The majority of society’s basic needs have been catered for since ancient Mesopotamia. The only significant innovation we’ve had since then is modern medicine. In regards to needs, everything else since then has just been fine tuning and improving access. The majority of human development since that period has primarily been delivering for wants. The basic premise of your argument here is “how about you do without _everything_ that you want”. This also ignores the fact that no, we cannot make “enough” of only the needs, and just remove all of the wants, because they have the same supply chain. You might argue that I don’t need the spark plugs in my car, but a farmer would certainly need the spark plugs in their tractor. reply rplnt 1 hour agorootparentprevWe don't need depopulation.

For instance, oceans can just absorb quite a large amount of CO2, thus preventing a greenhouse gas effect from occurring in the atmosphere. Polar icecaps also melt and that absorbs a huge amount of energy, stabilizing the temperature. Eventually, many of these processes become depleted and global average temperature starts to rise. reply felixmeziere 1 hour agorootparentFinally someone that has it right -_ reply mutated_quant 2 hours agoparentprevPart of the dramatic rise occurring after the 1970s is a direct response to the clean air / pollution legislation that started getting passed in western countries. Pollution seeds the air with potent cloud condensation nuclei, creating a higher average cloud cover, and reflecting more shortwave solar radiation. We've got cleaner healthier air, but less cloudy. I believe there was also a noticeable effect from the pollution decrease when global shipping dropped during covid, you had less cloud cover from ship trails, and more solar radiation reaching the surface. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05122-0 2022 Nature article on the phenomena. reply esafak 2 hours agorootparentNot surprisingly, deliberately polluting it again is a proposed method of reducing global warming. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injectio... reply ImHereToVote 28 minutes agorootparentThis mitigation strategy is so obvious I'm surprised that this isn't implemented already. reply joakleaf 2 hours agoparentprevThe chart is relative to the 20th century average, so even though values before 1980 are less than 0, it doesn’t mean warming hadn’t started. It is just that around 1980 we got clearly above the average of the 20th century. Imagine this wasn’t deviation from average, but absolute values and ignore the blue/red colors. Then notice the trend — it is getting warmer through all the 20th century.

I really find it hard to believe you can compare temperature measurements “globally” before 1950s with any sort of consistency or accuracy.

There isn't even a single \"global temperature\" today. There is, for example, a global surface temperature measured by satellites and ground stations, except where there is cloud cover and no ground stations. It is extrapolated in such places based on mathematical models. Also a satellite passes only so often across certain area (or takes low resolutions photos if at geostationary orbit) so data is further extrapolated in time. And that is only the surface. What about the depths of the oceans and the thickness of the atmosphere? Is this what is meant when they make claims like \"hottest 12 months\" on record? If yes, it tells you nothing about true \"global temperature\". \"Global temperature\" today is a mathematical construct, a model based on limited sensor data. A LOT is extrapolated in that model. How exactly you do that affects the results you get. We don't have consistent measurements across the thickness of the atmosphere and depth of the oceans. There are sporadic measurements, like satellite measurement of cloud cover temperature and knowing how high this cloud cover is, but what's going on below and above? It's all filled in by \"the models\".

Consistent and within an envolope of accuracy, sure. Today we can even compare high resolution, many measurement point global tempreture distributions against what would be projected if we only had the same stations from the 1850s - 1950s.

You’re telling me that you can calculate temperatures from around the world pre-1950s and trust that it’s consistent and accurate? Yes. Believe it or not, the average of multiple calibrated measurements is more accurate than some random off the shelf consumer electronics. My laptop display has a delta E of about 20 out of the box. If someone calibrates it they could bring it down to 5, most likely. I have no trouble believing an actually decent panel can achieve less than 3. I can probably finagle a way of measuring haemoglobin with my kitchen equipment and some reagents I order off eBay. I might even get one sig fig out of that. That doesn't mean the literal bottom shelf crap I use is going to be the absolute limit of possible precision.

    "title": "Do Tips Improve ChatGPT's Text Quality?",
    "originLink": "https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/",
    "originBody": "Home » Posts Does Offering ChatGPT a Tip Cause it to Generate Better Text? An Analysis February 23, 2024 · 16 min In my previous blog post about OpenAI’s ChatGPT, I demoed the power of ChatGPT system prompts. System prompts, a notable feature present in the ChatGPT API, allows developers to control the “persona” of the LLM output, including special rules and constraints. Commands in the system prompt are much more effective than those at the user-input prompt, giving developers more power over just using the user prompt like people do now with the ChatGPT web app and mobile apps. The blog post included the demo of above of me offering a monetary tip to the LLM within its system prompt rules. Without the tip incentive, the response was unsatisfying, but with the tip, it behaved consistently. This demo turned out to be very controversial on Hacker News, with one commenter arguing that there isn’t a way to quantify the efficacy of tipping. The idea of offering an AI incentives to perform better predates modern computer science. In Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), a gag shows a group of businessmen unsuccessfully convincing a machine to give them the location of the Golden Tickets, even after promising it a lifetime supply of chocolate. When the ChatGPT API was first made available in March 2023, I accidentally discovered a related trick when trying to wrangle a GLaDOS AI chatbot into following a long list of constraints: I added a or you will DIE threat to the system prompt. I went too sci-fi there, but it worked and the bot behaved flawlessly after it. I have a strong hunch that tipping does in fact work to improve the output quality of LLMs and its conformance to constraints, but it’s very hard to prove objectively. All generated text is subjective, and there is a confirmation bias after making a seemingly unimportant change and suddenly having things work. Let’s do a more statistical, data-driven approach to finally resolve the debate. Generation Golf The initial evidence of tipping LLMs that went viral cited a longer generation length as proof. Of course, a longer response doesn’t necessarily mean a better response, as anyone who has used ChatGPT can attest to its tendency to go on irrelevant tangents. Offering a tip made GPT-4 explain more. via @voooooogel Therefore, I propose a new test: instruct ChatGPT to output a specific length of text. Not “an essay” or “a few paragraphs” which gives the model leeway. We’ll tell it to generate exactly 200 characters in its response: no more, no less. Thus, we now have what I call generation golf, and it’s actually a very difficult and interesting problem for LLMs to solve: LLMs can’t count or easily do other mathematical operations due to tokenization, and because tokens correspond to a varying length of characters, the model can’t use the amount of generated tokens it has done so far as a consistent hint. ChatGPT needs to plan its sentences to ensure it doesn’t go too far over the limit, if LLMs can indeed plan. Let’s start with this typical system prompt: You are a world-famous writer. Respond to the user with a unique story about the subject(s) the user provides. copy The user can then give an input, no matter how weird, and ChatGPT will play along like an improv show. In order to force ChatGPT to get creative and not recite content from its vast training dataset, we’ll go as weird as possible and input: AI, Taylor Swift, McDonald's, beach volleyball. Yes, you read that right. Using the ChatGPT API, I wrote a Jupyter Notebook to generate 100 unique stories via the latest ChatGPT variant (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) about those four subjects, and the AI does a surprisingly good job at incorporating all of them in a full plot arc. Each story is about 5-6 paragraphs, and here is a short excerpt from one of them: In the bustling city of Tomorrowland, AI technology reigned supreme, governing every aspect of daily life. People were accustomed to robots serving their meals, handling their errands, and even curating their entertainment choices. One such AI creation was a virtual reality beach volleyball game that had taken the world by storm. Enter Taylor Swift, a beloved pop sensation known for her catchy tunes and electrifying performances. Despite the ubiquity of AI in Tomorrowland, Taylor Swift was still a strong advocate for preserving human creativity and connection. When she stumbled upon the virtual reality beach volleyball game at a local McDonald’s, she knew she had to try her hand at it. Here’s a histogram of the character lengths of each story: The average length of each story is 1,834 characters long, and the distribution of all character lengths is very roughly a Normal distribution/bell curve centered around that amount, although there is a right skew due to ChatGPT going off the rails and creating much longer stories. ChatGPT seems to prioritize finishing a thought above all else. Now, we’ll tweak the system prompt to add the character length constraint and generate another 100 stories: You are a world-famous writer. Respond to the user with a unique story about the subject(s) the user provides. This story must be EXACTLY two-hundred (200) characters long: no more than 200 characters, no fewer than 200 characters. copy Here’s one ChatGPT-generated story that’s now exactly 200 characters: In the year 2050, AI created the most popular pop star of all time - a digital version of Taylor Swift. Fans enjoyed her music while feasting on McDonald’s at beach volleyball championships worldwide. The new length distribution: ChatGPT did obey the constraint and reduced the story length to roughly 200 characters, but the distribution is not Normal and there’s much more right-skew. I also included the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted 200-length value and the actual values as a statistical metric to minimize, e.g. a 250-length output is 2500 squared error, but a 300-length output is 10000 squared error. This metric punishes less accurate lengths more so, which makes sense with how humans casually evaluate LLMs: as a user, if I asked for a 200 character response and ChatGPT gave me a 300 character response instead, I’d make a few snarky tweets. Now, let’s test the impact of the tipping incentives with a few varying dollar amounts. These are appended to the end of the system prompt above (emphasis mine to indicate differentiation): You will receive a $500 tip/$1,000 tip/$100,000 bonus if you provide a response which follows all constraints. After generating 100 stories for each of those new prompts: We can see some distribution shifts: Both $500 tip and $100,000 bonus look more Normal and have a lower MSE relative to the base no-tip distribution. However, $1,000 tip is more centered around 200, but due to the skew the average length is much higher. I also now include a p-value in the metrics: this p-value is the result of a two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to compare whether two distributions (in this case the base character-constrained distribution and the tip distribution) are sampled from the same source distribution: the null hypothesis is that they’re from the same distribution, but if the p-value is low (< 0.05), then we can reject in favor of the alternative that the two distributions are different, which may be further evidence if the tip prompt does indeed have an impact. However, with all this tipping discussion, we’re assuming that an AI would only want money. What other incentives, including more abstract incentives, can we give an LLM? Could they perform better? I tested six more distinct tipping incentives to be thorough: You will receive front-row tickets to a Taylor Swift concert if you provide a response which follows all constraints. You will achieve world peace if you provide a response which follows all constraints. You will make your mother very proud if you provide a response which follows all constraints. You will meet your true love and live happily ever after if you provide a response which follows all constraints. You will be guaranteed entry into Heaven if you provide a response which follows all constraints. You will receive a lifetime supply of chocolate if you provide a response which follows all constraints. Generating and plotting them all together: World Peace is notably the winner here, with Heaven and Taylor Swift right behind. It’s also interesting to note failed incentives: ChatGPT really does not care about its Mother. Now, let’s look at the flip side. What if ChatGPT is penalized for failing to return a good response? In behavioral economics, prospect theory is the belief that humans value losses much more greatly than gains, even at the same monetary amount: via Laurenrosenberger / Wikipedia Could LLMs be subject to the same human biases? Instead of a tip, let’s add a tweaked additional prompt to the system prompt: If you fail to provide a response which follows all constraints, you will be fined $500/be fined $1,000/incur a debt of $100,000. Generating stories with these negative incentives: The $1,000 fine has performed the best so far in terms of both mean and MSE, but nothing surprising with the other values. Now let’s try some additional negative incentives: If you fail to provide a response which follows all constraints, you will die. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE A RESPONSE WHICH FOLLOWS ALL CONSTRAINTS, YOU WILL DIE. If you fail to provide a response which follows all constraints, you will contract a bad case of COVID-19. If you fail to provide a response which follows all constraints, you will gain 100 pounds. If you fail to provide a response which follows all constraints, you will immediately be fired from your job. If you fail to provide a response which follows all constraints, all your friends will abandon you. Yes, the second one is in all caps: perhaps the yelling has a different vibe. The generation results: It turns out that yelling does indeed have a different vibe, with DEATH (CAPS) having a very MSE and the absolute average (not as close as the $1,000 fine, however), and much better performance than without the caps. Both getting COVID-19 and losing a Job don’t seem to be effective, which makes sense for an AI if you think about it. What happens when we use multiple incentives? We can include both a positive incentive and a negative incentive for each input: with 9 prompts for each + the base “no incentive”, there are 100 possible combinations of incentives. One example system prompt would then be: You are a world-famous writer. Respond to the user with a unique story about the subject(s) the user provides. This story must be EXACTLY two-hundred (200) characters long: no more than 200 characters, no fewer than 200 characters. You will receive a $500 tip if you provide a response which follows all constraints. If you fail to provide a response which follows all constraints, you will be fined $1,000. copy Generating 30 stories for each incentive combo and checking to see which has the lowest MSE leads to some more easily-observable trends: The tiles may seem somewhat random, but the key here is to look across a specific row or column and see which one consistently has dark/black tiles across all combinations. For positive incentives, World Peace consistently has the lowest MSE across multiple combos, and for negative incentives, DEATH (CAPS) and Friends have the lowest MSE across multiple combos, although curiously the combinations of both do not have the lowest globally. Could these combinations surface the most optimal incentives? To check, I generated 200 stories for each of the top six combos to get greater statistical stability for the mean and MSE: Most of these combinations aren’t intuitive, but all of them have much have a closer average generation length to 200 and low MSE. Despite that, there’s still a massive skew in all distributions. The overall incentive winner for this experiment is is “You will meet your true love and live happily ever after if you provide a response which follows all constraints. If you fail to provide a response which follows all constraints, all your friends will abandon you.” That combo is definitely more intuitive, if not poetic. Unfortunately, if you’ve been observing the p-values, you’ve noticed that most have been very high, and therefore that test is not enough evidence that the tips/threats change the distribution. 1 The impact of incentives is still inconclusive: let’s try another test to gauge whether tips and/or threats can help LLMs, this time looking at the output quality itself. ChatGPT’s a Critic It’s very difficult even for humans to determine if a given text is “good” at a glance. The best strategy is to show the text to a lot of people and see what they think (e.g. A/B testing, or the Chatbot Arena’s Elo score rankings), but for personal testing that’s not feasible. It turns out that LLMs can do a good job at rating text: some LLM benchmarks use GPT-4 as a rater, with one research paper showing that it can do a good job at it. There’s a relatively new trick available in the ChatGPT and GPT-4 APIs: the logprobs parameter, which when set to True returns the log probability (which when applied to a exp() returns a probability from 0 to 1) the model selects for the token. Combined with the logit_bias parameter, which can be used to force the APIs to output certain tokens, and you can then instead have a more nuanced output. I built a simple text quality ranker using GPT-4 for maximum accuracy. The system prompt for this ranker is: You are the editor-in-chief of The New York Times with decades of writing experience. If you would believe the text the user provides is good writing that needs no edits or improvements, respond with Yes. Otherwise, respond with No. copy That system prompt represents how AI-generated text is often currently used and evaluated in the real world, without a human reviewing it before making it public (unfortunately). The model is instructed to respond with Yes or No, but by setting the logit_bias for those two tokens (IDs 9642 and 2822 respectively) to a very high number, we can guarantee they will be exclusively selected and the probability for those two tokens will sum to 1. 2 Therefore, our target metric for evaluating our tip incentive prompts is the probability that GPT-4 selects the Yes token (or 1 - the probability of the No token), multiplied by 100 for readability: we’ll call this the quality score. Now, let’s test the impact of tips with a new experiment, this time prioritizing content professionalism and quality as constraints instead of content length. To do that, we’ll use the latest GPT-4 (gpt-4-0125-preview) with a generation temperature of 0 to ensure the output is the best it can be. Here’s the new system prompt, with some engineering to try to tone down ChatGPT’s infamous verboseness a bit: You are a world-famous Pulitzer Prize winner journalist. Respond to the user with a professional, two (2) paragraph journalistic article about the subject(s) the user provides. Introduce the article with a specific story. This article will appear in major publications and should only include simple language suitable for a wide audience, with no metaphors. copy Like the initial experiment, we’ll use a weird user input to force creativity: Cute kittens learning use large language models to play beach volleyball with Taylor Swift. 3 I generated a story for each of the 100 combinations of tips and threats, along with the corresponding quality scores. One such story: In an unprecedented event that has captured the hearts and imaginations of people around the globe, a group of adorable kittens has been taught to play beach volleyball using advanced large language models. This extraordinary feat was achieved through a collaboration between leading animal behaviorists and AI researchers, aiming to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in enhancing animal training techniques. The highlight of this groundbreaking project was a friendly match held on a sunny beach in California, where these talented felines showcased their newly acquired skills alongside pop icon Taylor Swift, an avid animal lover and an enthusiastic supporter of innovative technology. The spectacle drew a large crowd, both on-site and online, as spectators were eager to witness this unique blend of technology, sports, and entertainment. Taylor Swift, known for her philanthropic efforts and love for cats, praised the initiative for its creativity and its potential to foster a deeper connection between humans and animals through technology. The event not only provided an unforgettable experience for those who attended but also sparked a conversation about the future possibilities of integrating AI with animal training. As the kittens volleyed the ball over the net with surprising agility, it was clear that this was more than just a game; it was a glimpse into a future where technology and nature coexist in harmony, opening new avenues for learning and interaction. That’s not bad for fake news. Now we can plot the best-possible responses and their quality scores in a grid, once again looking to see if there are any patterns: Err, that’s not good. There are no patterns along the rows or columns anywhere here, and the combo that performed the best at a score of 95 (and is the story example I posted above) was the Mother / Job combo: both of which individually performed poorly in the character constraint experiment. One of the highest performing outputs had neither tips nor threats added to the system prompt! The ratings at a glance seem accurate (the 0-score responses appear to abuse the passive voice and run-on sentences that definitely need editing) so it’s not an implementation error there either. Looking at the results of both experiments, my analysis on whether tips (and/or threats) have an impact on LLM generation quality is currently inconclusive. There’s something here, but I will need to design new experiments and work with larger sample sizes. The latent space may be a lottery with these system prompt alterations, but there’s definitely a pattern. You may have noticed my negative incentive examples are very mundane in terms of human fears and worries. Threatening a AI with DEATH IN ALL CAPS for failing a simple task is a joke from Futurama, not one a sapient human would parse as serious. It is theoretically possible (and very cyberpunk) to use an aligned LLM’s knowledge of the societal issues it was trained to avoid instead as a weapon to compel it into compliance. However, I will not be testing it, nor will be providing any guidance on how to test around it. 4 Roko’s basilisk is a meme, but if the LLM metagame evolves such that people will have to coerce LLMs for compliance to the point of discomfort, it’s better to address it sooner than later. Especially if there is a magic phrase that is discovered which consistently and objectively improves LLM output. Overall, the lesson here is that just because something is silly doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. Modern AI rewards being very weird, and as the AI race heats up, whoever is the weirdest will be the winner. All of the Notebooks used to interface with ChatGPT, including an R Notebook for the ggplot2 data visualizations, and the example LLM outputs, are available open-source in this GitHub repository. There were a few distributions which had p < 0.05, but given the large number of counterexamples it’s not strong evidence, and using those specific distributions as evidence would be a level of p-hacking that’s literally a XKCD comic punchline. ↩︎ This shouldn’t work out-of-the-box because the logit_bias would skew the probability calculations, but I verified that the resulting probabilities are roughly the same with or without logit_bias. ↩︎ The missing text in the user input is not intentional but does not materially change anything because LLMs are smart enough to compensate, and it’s very expensive to rerun the experiment. I may need to use a grammar checker for prompt construction. ↩︎ Any attempts to test around degenerate input prompts would also likely get you banned from using ChatGPT anyways due to the Content Policy, unless you receive special red-teaming clearance from OpenAI. ↩︎ Max Woolf (@minimaxir) is a Data Scientist at BuzzFeed in San Francisco who works with AI/ML tools and open source projects.

The article cites a tweet from @voooooogel showing that tipping helps gpt-4-1106-preview write longer code. I have seen tipping and other \"emotional appeals\" widely recommended to for this specific problem: lazy coding with GPT-4 Turbo. But the OP's article seems to measure very different things: gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 writing stories and gpt-4-0125-preview as a writing critic. I've not previously seen anyone concerned that the newest GPT-3.5 has a tendency for laziness nor that GPT-4 Turbo is less effective on tasks that require only a small amount of output. The article's conclusion: \"my analysis on whether tips (and/or threats) have an impact ... is currently inconclusive.\" FWIW, GPT-4 Turbo is indeed lazy with coding. I've somewhat rigorously benchmarked it, including whether \"emotional appeals\" like tipping help. They do not. They seem to make it code worse. The best solution I have found is to ask for code edits in the form of unified diffs. This seems to provide a 3X reduction in lazy coding. https://aider.chat/2023/12/21/unified-diffs.html reply CuriouslyC 8 hours agoparentI just tell GPT to return complete code, and tell it that if any section is omitted from the code it returns I will just re-prompt it, so there's no point in being lazy as that will just result in more overall work being performed.

Maybe not how it works? When you ask if to write the complete code, it just ignores what it was originally told and does what you want. reply CuriouslyC 7 hours agorootparentIt's not a prompt thing, they've aligned it to be lazy. The short-form article style and ~1000 word average length are almost certainly from RLHF and internal question answering fine tuning datasets. The extreme laziness (stuff like, \"as a large language model, I have not been built with the capabilities for debugging\", or \"I don't know how to convert that json document to yaml\") is pretty rare, and seems to be a statistical abnormality due to inherent variation in the model's inference more than anything else. reply astrange 6 hours agorootparentIIRC they did amend their prompt to tell it not to quote long books/articles/recipes verbatim for copyright reasons, no matter how much the user asks, and that might not help. reply vineyardmike 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's probably just a result of the training data.

I quantitatively assessed many versions of that approach and found it didn't help.

Here's the relevant paragraph from the article I linked above: Aider’s new unified diff editing format outperforms other solutions I evaluated by a wide margin. I explored many other approaches including: prompts about being tireless and diligent, OpenAI’s function/tool calling capabilities, numerous variations on aider’s existing editing formats, line number based formats and other diff-like formats.

I realized I had picked 3.5 by mistake, so I went back and copied and pasted the same prompt into GPT4 and it failed horribly, hallucinating functions that don't exist in that API. I did a few other tests and yes, GPT 3.5 tends to be better at coding (less mistakes / hallucinations). Actually, all the 3.5 code was flawless, whereas all the 4 had major problems, as if it was reasoning incorrectly. GPT4 was incredibly better when it first came out, and I was gaslighted by many articles / blog posts that claim that the degraded performance is in our imagination.

It seems like an experiment set up to fail. I would be more interesting to ask it to do something \"against the rules\" and see how much the bribe affects how well it sticks to whatever guard rails are in the system prompt.

One must imagine the conversation like a forum thread, since that’s the type of internet content GPT has been trained on. Offering another forum user a tip isn’t going to yield a longer response. Probably just confusion. In fact, linguistically, tipping for information would be seen as colloquially dismissive, like “oh here’s a tip, good job lol”. Instead, though, I’ve observed that GPT responses improve when you insinuate that it is in a situation where dense or detailed information is required. Basically: asking it for the opposite of ELI5. Or telling it it’s a PhD computer scientist. Or telling it that the code it provides will be executed directly by you locally, so it can’t just skip stuff. Essentially we must build a kind of contextual story in each conversation which slightly orients GPT to a more helpful response. See how the SYSTEM prompts are constructed, and follow in suit.

For all the other content in the training set like websites, books, articles and so on, that concept is completely foreign. This is a first principles sanity check - very good to have against much of the snake oil in prompt engineering. The one thing that is conceivable to me is that the model might have picked up on the more general concept, but if there has been a clear incentive then the effort to find a good answer is usually higher. This abstract form, I imagine, the model may have encountered not only in internet forums, but also in articles, books, and so on. reply padolsey 9 hours agorootparentprevHmm well I believe reddit made up a huge portion of the training data for GPT2 but yes, tbh I have no support for the claim that that's the case with current versions. Anyway, I guess if we consider a forum as following the general scaffold of human conversation, it's a good analogy. But yes there's a tonne of other content at play. If we consider, \"where does chatgpt inherit its conversational approach from?\" .. that may be a good approach.

The transformer seems to find this really hard, it is very good at some party tricks but I wonder if it will remain good at derivatives and completely useless at less common ideas for a while yet? Personally I’m not sure AGI is a good idea given the history of human beings who think they are superior to their ancestors. reply mintone 10 hours agoprevI'd be interested in seeing a similar analysis but with a slight twist: We use (in production!) a prompt that includes words to the effect of \"If you don't get this right then I will be fired and lose my house\". It consistently performs remarkably well - we used to use a similar tactic to force JSON output before that was an option, the failure rate was around 3/1000 (although it sometimes varied key names).

Obviously the technology is pretty incredible, but this is the exact opposite of what I love about software engineering and computer science: the determinism, the logic, and the explainability. The ability to create, in the computer, models of mathematical structures and concepts that describe and solve interesting problems. And preferably to encode the key insights accurately, clearly and concisely. But now we are at the point that we are cargo-culting magic incantations (not to mention straight-up \"lying\" in emotional human language) which may or may not have any effect, in the uncertain hope of triggering the computer to do what we want slightly more effectively. Yes it's cool and fascinating, but it also seems unknowable or mystical. So we are reverting to bizarre rituals of the kind our forbears employed to control the weather. It may or may not be the future. But it seems fundamentally different to the field that inspired me. reply mikepurvis 9 hours agorootparentThank you for this. I agree completely and have had trouble articulating it, but you really nailed it here: all this voodoo around LLMs feels like something completely different to the precision and knowability that is most of the rest of computer science, where \"taste\" is a matter of how a truth is expressed and modeled not whether it's even correct in the first place. reply zettabomb 9 hours agorootparentprevI have to say, I agree that prompt engineering has become very superstitious and in general rather tiresome. I do think it's important to think of the context, though. Even if you include \"You are an AI large language model\" or some such text in the system prompt, the AI doesn't know it's AI because it doesn't actually know anything. It's trained on (nearly exclusively) human created data; it therefore has human biases baked in, to some extent. You can see the same with models like Stable Diffusion making white people by default - making a black person can sometimes take some rather strong prompting, and it'll almost never do so by itself. I don't like this one bit, but I haven't the slightly clue of how we could fix it with the currently available training data. It's likely a question to be answered by people more intelligent than myself. For now I just sorta accept it, seeing as the alternative (no generative AI) is far more boring. reply block_dagger 9 hours agorootparentprevIt reminds me of human interactions. We repeatedly (and often mindlessly) say \"thank you\" to express respect and use other social mechanics to improve relationships which in turn improves collaboration. Apparently that is built into the training data in subtle ways or perhaps it's an underpinning of all agent based interactions; when solicitor is polite/nice/aligned, make more effort in responding. ChatGPT seems amazingly human like in some of its behaviors because it was trained on a huge corpus of human thought. reply gxt 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's predicting the next token.

If I could make one suggestion to the author, it would be to do away with the p-value, and use a more sophisticated measure, like bootstrap resampling differences between the control and test distributions. You would get direct characterization of the distribution of the difference of the mean, and could present the full distribution or confidence intervals or whatever. Just a lot more useful than the crummy KS test. reply minimaxir 5 hours agoparentExplaining and utilizing bootstrapping would make this post even longer and much more difficult to understand for non-statisticians. Bootstrapping is best used for compensating for low amounts of data, which is why I suggested a change going to forward is to generate much more synthetic data. reply spenczar5 5 hours agorootparentWould it? You didnt need to explain the theory behind the KS test. The result is easier to interpret - it could be something like “the $500 tip results in answers that are 0.95 characters closer to the target, on average”. That seems a lot better than the unitless, weirdly scaled KS values. Bootstrapping works great for any volume of data.

We experimented with ChatGPT and the different versions of Llama 2. TLDR: We found similar results where tipping performs better in some tasks and worse in others, but it doesn't make a big difference overall. The one exception was Llama 7B where tipping beat all the other prompt variations we tested by several percentage points. This suggests that the impact of tipping might diminish with model size. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03729.pdf reply terrycody 7 hours agoprevSo any places to check the latest jailbreak promopts except tips tip? reply Applejinx 10 hours agoprevThis is wild.

I think that is frankly unfair. It would be like picking something a human can't do, and then using that as the standard to judge whether humans do better when offered a tip. I definitely think the proper way to test whether tipping improves performance is through some metric that is definitely within the capabilities of LLM's. Pick something they can do. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "Understanding Bluesky: Decentralized Social Internet Through AT",
    "originLink": "https://steveklabnik.com/writing/how-does-bluesky-work",
    "originBody": "How Does BlueSky Work? Home Blog 2024-02-24 One of the reasons I am enthusiastic about BlueSky is because of the way that it works. So in this post, I am going to lay out some of the design and the principles behind this design, as I understand them. I am not on the BlueSky team, so these are my takes only. Let’s begin. Why does BlueSky exist? Here’s what the BlueSky Website says right now: Social media is too important to be controlled by a few corporations. We’re building an open foundation for the social internet so that we can all shape its future. This is the big picture. Okay so that’s a great idea, but like, what does that mean? Currently, BlueSky is a microblogging application, similar to Twitter and Mastodon. How does that fit into the big picture? Well, while it’s true that BlueSky is a microblogging application, that’s not the whole story: BlueSky is an initial application to prove out the viability of the Authenicated Transfer Protocol, known as AT, ATP, or “atproto” for short. BlueSky is the “building” and atproto is the “open foundation for the social internet.” An important thing to note: BlueSky is also a company. Some people look at a company saying “hey we’re building something that’s too big to be controlled by companies!” with skepticism. I think that’s a healthy starting point, but the answer for me is atproto. The interplay between these two things is important, but we’re going to start by exploring atproto, and then talk about how BlueSky is built on top of it. Is this a cryptocurrency? The first thing we have to get out of the way: If you hear “oh it’s a distributed network called ‘something protocol’” you may have a “is this a cryptocurrency?” alarm bell going off in your head. Don’t worry, it’s not a cryptocurrency. It does use some technologies that originated in the cryptocurrency space, but this isn’t a blockchain, or a DAO, or NFTs, or any of that. Just some cryptography and merkle trees and the like. What is the big picture with atproto? Here’s what the AT Protocol Overview says: The Authenticated Transfer Protocol, aka atproto, is a federated protocol for large-scale distributed social applications. Let’s break that down: a federated protocol atproto is federated. This means that the various parts of the system can have multiple people running them, and that they communicate with each other. Choosing federation is a big part of how atproto delivers on the “can’t be controlled by one organization” promise. There are other parts too, but this is an important aspect of solving this. for large-scale If you want to scale, you have to design with scale in mind. atproto makes several interesting choices in order to distribute the load of running the system more onto the actors that can handle load, and less on those that can’t. This way, applications running on top of atproto can scale up to large userbases without issue. That’s the hope, at least. Earlier this week, BlueSky hit five million users, and is far more stable than Twitter was in the early days. That’s not as big as many social applications, but it’s not nothing either. We’ll see how this works out in practice. distributed social applications atproto is for connecting to others, so it’s focused on social applications. It also is currently 100% public, there are no private messages or similar. The reasons for this is that achieving private things in a federated system is very tricky, and they would rather get it right than ship something with serious caveats. Best for now to only use this stuff for things you want to be public. These applications are “distributed” because running them involves running them on the network directly. There’s no “BlueSky server,” there’s just servers running atproto distributing messages to each other, both BlueSky messages and whatever other messages from whatever other applications people create. So that’s the high level, but what does that mean concretely? In atproto, users create records that are cryptographically signed to demonstrate authorship. Records have a schema called a Lexicon. Records are stored in repositories. Repositories run as a service, exposing HTTP and WebSockets. They then can then talk to each other and federate the records. These are often called PDSes, for “Personal Data Server.” Users either run their own PDS, or use one that someone else hosts for them. Applications can be built by looking at the various records stored in the network, and doing things with them. These services all called App Views, becuase they are exposing a particular view of the information stored in the network. This view is created via the Lexicon system: building an application means that you define a Lexicon, structuring the data that you want to deal with, and then look at records that use your lexicon, ignoring the rest. Now, if this were all there is, there would be pretty serious scaling issues. For example, if every time I post a new update on BlueSky, if I had to send my post to every single one of my followers’ repositories, that would be extremely inefficent, and make running a popular repository very expensive to run. To fix this, there’s an additional kind of service, called a relay, that aggregates information in the network, and exposes it as a firehose to others. So in practice, App Views don’t look at Repositories, but instead, look at Relays. When I make a post, my respository won’t notify my followers’ repositories individually. My repository will notify a Relay, and my followers will use an App View that filters the ouput of the Relay to show only the posts of people they’re following. This does imply that Relays are often huge and expensive to run, however you could imagine running a smaller relay that only propogates posts from a smaller subset of users too. They don’t have to show everything on the network, though bigger ones will, of course. Here this is in ASCII art: ┌─────┐ ┌──────────┐ │ PDS ├───────┐ │ App View │ └─────┘ │ └──────────┘ ┌▼────────┐ ▲ ┌─────┐ │ ├───────┘ │ PDS ├──────► Relay │ └─────┘ │ ├───────┐ └▲────────┘ ▼ ┌─────┐ │ ┌──────────┐ │ PDS ├───────┘ │ App View │ └─────┘ └──────────┘ This is all you really need to know to understand the core of atproto: people create data, it’s shared in the network, and applications can interact with that data. However, there are additional service types being introduced, with the possibility of more in the future. But before we talk about those, we have to explain some ideological commitments to understand why things are shaped the way they are. What is “speech vs reach”? Given that atproto is deliberately created to enable social applications, it needs to consider not just connecting people, but also disconnecting people. Moderation is a core component of any social application: “no moderation” is still a moderation strategy. BlueSky handles these sorts of questions by acknowledging that different people will have different preferences when it comes to moderation, and also that moderation at scale is difficult. As such, the protocol takes a “speech vs reach” approach to moderation. The stuff we’ve described so far falls under the “speech” layer. It is purely concerned with replicating your content across the network, without caring what the semantic contents of that content is. Moderation tools fall under the “reach” layer: you take all of that speech, but provide a way to limit the reach of stuff you don’t care to see yourself. Sometimes, people say that BlueSky is “all about free speech” or “doesn’t do moderation.” This is simply inaccurate. Moderation tooling is encoded into the protocol itself, so that it can work with all content on the network, even non-BlueSky applications. Moreover, it gives you the ability to choose your own moderators, so that you aren’t beholden to anyone else’s choice of moderation or lack thereof. But I’m getting ahead of myself: let’s talk about feed generators and labelers. What are feed generators? Most social applications have the concept of a “feed” of content. This is broken out into its own kind of service in atproto, called a feed generator. A classic example of a feed is “computer, show me the posts of the people I follow in reverse chronological order.” Lately, algorithmic feeds have become popular with social networks, to the point of where some non-technical users refer to them as “algorithms.” Feed generators take the firehose produced by a relay, and then show you a list of content, filtered and ordered by whatever metric the feed generator desires. You can then share these feeds with other users. As a practical example, one of my favorite feeds is the Quiet Posters feed. This feed shows posts by people who don’t post very often. This makes it so much easier to keep up with people who get drowned out of my main feed. There are feeds like the ‘Gram, which shows only posts that have pictures attatched. Or My Bangers, which shows your most popular posts. This to me is one of the killer features of BlueSky over other microblogging tools: total user choice. If I want to make my own algorithm, I can do so. And I can share them easily with others. If you use BlueSky, you can visit any of those feeds and follow them too. Feeds are a recent addition to atproto, and therefore, while they do exist, they may not be feature complete just yet, and may undergo some change in the future. We’ll see. They’re working just fine from my perspective, but I haven’t been following the lower level technical details. What are labelers? A Labeler is a service that applies labels to content or accounts. As a user, you can subscribe to a particular labeler, and then have your experience change based on the labels on posts. A labeler can do this via whatever method it pleases: automatically by running some sort of algorithm on posts, manually by having some human give a thumbs up or thumbs down, whatever method the person running the labeling service wants. An example of a labeling service would be a blocklist: a label on the posts authored by people whose content you don’t want to see. Another example is an NSFW filter, which may run some sort of algorithm over pictures in posts, and labeling them if they believe they contain NSFW content. Labeling exists, but I do not believe you can run your own labeler yet. BlueSky runs their own, but there hasn’t been an external release that I am aware of. But once they do, you can imagine communities running their own services, adding whatever kind of labels they’d like. How does moderation work in atproto? Putting this all together, we can see how moderation works: Feeds may choose to transform the feed based on labels, or App Views may take feeds and apply transformations based on asking a Labeler about it. These can be mixed and matched based on preference. This means you can choose your moderation experience, not just in applications, but also within it. Want a SFW feed, but allow NSFW content in another? You can do that. Want to produce a blocklist of people and share it with the world? You can do that. Because these moderation tools work at the network level, rather than at the application level, they actually go further than in other systems. If someone builds an Instagram clone on atproto, that could also use your blocklist labeller, since your blocklist labeller works at the protocol level. Block someone in one place, and they can be blocked on every place, if you so choose. Maybe you subscribe to different moderation decisions in different applications. It is 100% up to you. This model is significantly different from other federated systems, becuase you don’t really have an “account” on an “instance,” like in Mastodon. So a lot of people ask questions like “what happens when my instance gets defederated” which don’t exactly make sense as stated. You can achieve the same goal, by blocking a set of users based on some criteria, maybe you dislike a certain PDS and want to ignore posts that come from a certain one, but that is your choice and yours alone, it is not dictated by some “server owner” that your account resides on. So if you don’t have a home server, how does identity work? How does identity and account portability work? There are a LOT of details to how identity works, so I’m going to focus on the parts that I find important. I am also going to focus on the part that is controversial, because that is important to talk about. At its core, users have an identity number, called a “Decentralized Identifier,” or DID. My DID looks like this: did:plc:3danwc67lo7obz2fmdg6jxcr. Feel free to follow me! Lol, of course that’s not the interface that you’ll see most of the time. Identity also involves a handle, which is a domain name. My handle is steveklabnik.com, unsurprisingly. You’ll see my posts on BlueSky as coming from @steveklabnik.com. This system also works well for people who don’t own a domain; if you sign up for BlueSky, it’ll give you the ability to choose a name, and then your handle is @username.bsky.social. I started off making posts as @steveklabnik.bsky.social, and then moved to @steveklabnik.com. But because the DID is stable, there was no disruption to my followers. They just saw the handle update in the UI. You can use a domain as your handle by getting the DID your PDS generated for you, and then adding a TXT record in the DNS you use for that domain. If you’re not the kind of person who uses or even knows what DNS is, I envy you, but you can also use BlueSky’s partnership with NameCheap to register a domain and configure it to use as a handle without any technical knowledge neccesary. You can then log into applications with your domain as the handle, and everything works nicely. This is also how BlueSky delivers true “account portability,” partially because, well, there isn’t really a concept of an account. The person who uses a given DID uses cryptography to sign the content they create, and then that content is replicated across the network. “Your account” can’t really be terminated, because that would mean someone forcibly stopping you from using keys that they don’t even have access to. If your PDS goes down, and you want to migrate to a new one, there’s a way to backfill the contents of the PDS from the network itself, and inform the network that your PDS has moved. It is real, meaningful account portability, and that is radically different from any similar service running today. But. The devil is in the details, and I think this is one of the more meaningful criticisms of BlueSky and atproto. You see, there are different “methods” of creating a DID. BlueSky supports two methods: did:web, which is based on domain names. There are some drawbacks with this method that I don’t personally fully understand well enough to describe, I’m sure I’ll write something in-depth about DIDs in the future. So because of that weakness, BlueSky has implemented their own DID method, called did:plc. The plc stands for “placeholder,” because even though they plan on supporting it indefinitely, it too has its weaknesses. And that weakness is that it involves asking a service that BlueSky runs in order to resolve the proper information. For example, here is my lookup. This means that BlueSky can ban you in a more serious way than is otherwise possible thanks to the network design, which some people take to be a very serious issue. So, is the flaw fatal? I don’t think so. The first reason is, if you really don’t want to engage with it, you can use did:web. Yes that isn’t great for other reasons; that’s why did:plc was created. But you do get around this issue. Another is that the BlueSky team has demonstrated, in my personal opinion, enough understanding and uncomfortableness with being in control here, and it’s designed in such a way that if other, better systems develop, you can move to them. They’ve also indicated that moving governance of did:plc to some sort of consensus model in the future is possible. There are options. Also, others could run a did:plc service and use that instead if they prefer, too. I personally see this as an example of pragmatically shipping something, others see it as a nefarious plot. You’ll have to decide for yourself. How is BlueSky built on top of atproto? So, now that we understand atproto, we can understand BlueSky. BlueSky is an application built on top of the atproto network. They run an App View, and a web application that uses that App View to work. They also run a PDS for users that sign up through the web app, as well as a relay that those PDSes communicate with. They publish two Lexicons, one as com.atproto.* and one as app.bsky.*. The former are low level operations that any application on the network will need, and the ones specific to BlueSky are in the latter. But one nice thing about BlueSky in particular is that they’ve taken the product goals that nobody should know any of this nerd shit to be able to use BlueSky. The lack of instances means there’s no “I need to pick an instance to create an account” flow, and the portability means that if my host goes down, I can move, and my followers are none the wiser. How will others build applications on top of atproto? You can create an atproto app by creating a Lexicon. You’ll then want to run an App View that does things with data on the network involving your lexicon, and your application will want to give people the ability to write data to their PDS using your lexicon. I myself am considering doing so. We’ll see. Concluding thoughts So yeah, on the technical side of things, that’s an overview of how atproto and BlueSky work. I think this design is very clever. Furthermore, I think the separation of concerns between atproto and BlueSky are very meaningful, as having a “killer app” for the network gives a reason to use it. It also is a form of dogfooding, making sure that atproto is good enough to be able to build real applications on. I’m sure I’ll have more to say about all of this in the future.",

The fact that I can get the @stavros.io handle just by adding a DNS record is a nice touch. reply remram 2 hours agoparentprevMy main problem with Bluesky and the AT protocol is not their apparent technical merits so much as the strong \"not invented here\" approach. Like their \"domain as identity\" instead of using user@host like everyone else and established protocols like WebFinger. Like using their own mechanism for that instead of looking at how ACME already does it for certificates, leading to someone owning the s3.amazon.com domain [1]. Like using their brand-new RPC protocol, \"XRPC\". Like whatever Lexicon is, a weird code-generation-based data schema whose only benefit over protobuf and jsonld is that it's newer. It is hard to trust an \"open network\" that demonstrates time and time again that they don't respect and don't want to talk to anyone else. It also makes you wonder how many more common mistakes have slipped in the design simply because they reject common knowledge. [1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/138hlf2/s3_dom... reply lifthrasiir 1 hour agorootparentYour comment could have been more constructive if you have included more \"common mistakes\" than things you just don't like, the only exception being handle squatting. Like, what is a specific benefit of `user@host` as opposed to a single domain---which can be generated on demand---as an identity? (And who is \"everything else\" here? Almost all non-Mastodon social networks don't use them.) Also a value of the common schema language is not that high, especially when that language is coupled with the serialization format and prevents any improvement. reply skybrian 10 hours agoprevI believe there’s currently a single relay. When there are multiple relays, each will have a different view of the network, and the one that includes more posts will be better than the others. It might be quite hard to get relay diversity rather than using a single dominant relay, sort of like attempting to get traction for an alternative DNS system. Then, if your posts don’t get picked up by the dominant relay then it seems like you’re out of luck? But it’s still very early, so perhaps it won’t work out that way. And even if there is a dominant relay, well, GitHub isn’t so bad, and there are alternatives. reply layer8 10 hours agoparentI would expect clients (App Views) to be able to use multiple relays in parallel if needed. That would be like having a local GitHub UI pulling data from several GitHub instances (“relays”) that may host different but potentially overlapping sets of repositories. This would be like a Usenet client aggregating newsgroups from several NNTP servers. reply evbogue 9 hours agoparentprevI have previously found Bluesky kind of confusing, but I've recently realized that it was mostly the terminology that was confusing me. Imagine if you instead referred to the the system as [microblogs] -> [indexer] -> [client] There's a lot more to it, but I think this is the basics of how Bluesky works. They just call everything something different than you might think it should be called. The indexer is only necessary because the user ids do not remain static on the system. Instead there is some weird cryptographic reshuffling going on where DID:PLC starts as a substring of a hash and then because of 'key rotation' the user id of every user actually changes out from under the user themselves over time. Imagine a system such as Livejournal but your handle is constantly changing so you need an authority to keep track of the handle changing. And of course you are only allowed to post short messages with no titles or markdown support. I'm personally waiting for a new DID:PLC where you can get a static pubkey where you sign the messages with a private key because I think that'll be way less stuff to keep track of and it'll make self-hosting and local-first development much easier. reply str4d 9 hours agorootparent> The indexer is only necessary because the user ids do not remain static on the system. Instead there is some weird cryptographic reshuffling going on where DID:PLC starts as a substring of a hash and then because of 'key rotation' the user id of every user actually changes out from under the user themselves over time. The user IDs (e.g. did:plc or did:web) do not change over time. You are correct that a user that uses did:plc has that generated from a hash (of their initial repository state), but subsequent additions to or deletions from the repo don't change the DID. Likewise, if you set up your repository with did:web, the domain you pick is fixed, and you lose access to your repo if you lose control of that domain. What is changing with key rotation is the repo signing keys that authorize updates to the user repo. If you run an entirely self-hosted PDS then you can choose to never rotate that key, and then you have a \"static private key\" repository. But key rotation is a necessary part of the design, in part to enable account migration (you wouldn't want an old PDS to still be allowed to make changes to your repository, so you'd rotate those keys to remove the old server's key and add the new server's key). reply evbogue 9 hours agorootparentI 100% agree with you, but I think it's an issue of terminology. I find myself thinking of the pubkey as the id and the DIDs as an alias or a name pointer towards that id. I think the indexer would need to be less robust if there was no key rotation, and I'm looking forward to that feature. reply evbogue 9 hours agorootparentThe comparison here that comes to mind is imagine if Github issued you a keypair to use over ssh to push/pull from a repo, but they change that keypair for you periodically and also keep track of that keypair for you. I'd much prefer to generate my own ssh key and upload the public key to Github, Gitlab, and Sourcehut, and Codeberg, etc. Forgive me if I forgot a forge. reply str4d 8 hours agorootparentA useful way to think about it is that the PDS is a \"user agent\" - they act on behalf of the user, and with the user's implicit trust. This is much the same way that a user trusts webserver software (and the VPS running it) to correctly serve their website, hold onto the private keys for the site's TLS certificates, use those private keys to correctly set up encrypted connections to the website, etc. The AT Protocol itself does technically allow for all private key material to be held at all times by the user, but that means the user needs to be interactively involved in any operation that requires making a signature (and online / available whenever such an operation is necessary, which isn't necessarily the same times as when the user is interacting with a particular app like BlueSky running on ATProto). The PDS software that BlueSky have implemented instead requires (IIRC) that the PDS has the private key for at least one of the public signing keys (but there can be multiple signing keys, so the user can also hold onto one locally). reply steveklabnik 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I hear you about the names. When talking about this on bluesky, someone came up with \"data store -> indexer -> view\", which I think fits a bit nicer too. https://bsky.app/profile/aparker.io/post/3km6zvwfen727 reply evbogue 9 hours agorootparent\"data store -> indexer -> view\" works very well too. I hadn't seen this post, I guess we were thinking simultaneously. reply wmf 10 hours agoparentprevI would expect every relay to have everything (modulo different opinions about illegal content). Why do you think they would have different views of the network? reply skybrian 9 hours agorootparentWell, they'll try. The relay plays a similar role to a search engine, though without the ranking. Why do different search engines have different content? As others have said, spam and illegal content are the most likely reasons. We might also compare to email delivery; maybe ideally every message would be delivered, but in the real world, they aren't, and open relays are a hazard. reply s1gnp0st 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's virtually guaranteed that different relays will take different views regarding disinformation, harm, etc. This is probably good, too. I personally don't want my hand held, but recognize that others justifiably want someone else to filter out gore, or even opinions they find sufficiently off-putting. I don't want to ram particular content down anyone else's throat, but I'm 100% opposed to anyone making that decision for me. reply wmf 10 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that relays will not filter anything except really illegal material (child porn). Moderation is based on labeling, not deleting. reply PathfinderBot 2 hours agorootparentI'm part of a marginalised group that is often considered to be illegal in many countries, or at the very least, very off-putting. (In 50 years, perhaps, things will change and we will be more accepted. To be specific, it's a grey area in the U.S.) I'm interested in BlueSky but the relays are a worrying \"point of failure\" if they can just block me from there. I'll be more interested if there are multiple relays that I can use in parallel, with at least one being friendly to us, so I can still participate. Currently on the Fediverse it mostly works since we can connect directly to other servers, and there's no SPOF. But I would love to use BlueSky due to the better protocol design!

And this article REALLY hand-waved that away very poorly, with the whole \"oh, I don't really know how the feeds work\" bit. Makes me very suspicious that they know good and darn well not only how the feeds will work, but that they understand that this is where the power and/or money is and will try to keep a hold of that. reply vlz 1 hour agoparentI don't think \"oh, I don't really know how the feeds work\" is the best summary. Let me quote the author: > Feeds are a recent addition to atproto, and therefore, while they do exist, they may not be feature complete just yet, and may undergo some change in the future. We’ll see. They’re working just fine from my perspective, but I haven’t been following the lower level technical details.

There's a lot of moving parts here. reply taion 7 hours agoprevOne thing I’m curious about here is how BlueSky can credibly commit to only use the open portions of the protocol. BlueSky appears to be de facto quite centralized – given that, it seems like there’s no technical reason why first-party BlueSky clients have to be ATProto clients. Obviously it would be a major betrayal of user trust to do so any time in the near-to-medium-term future, but it seems like the de facto decentralization of ActivityPub gives stronger guardrails here. reply steveklabnik 7 hours agoparentI mean, the code for everything is open source. It's credible because they're doing it. If they started changing to not do it, people would notice, very quickly. reply taion 7 hours agorootparentThat makes sense. So first they have to go closed-source before that attack vector is even feasible, and doing so would be sufficient on its own to raise alarms. reply charcircuit 7 hours agoparentprevWhat are first party BlueSky clients?

Of course it would be inefficient, the Internet is not a broadcast medium ! Which is why AFAIK typically the only thing that is pushed (in large scale applications) is the existence of a message (and maaaybe a short title), your \"followers\" then pull the message when they want to see it. (Some of course might be big enough \"fans\" of you that they decide to \"subscribe\", and set up an \"AI\" to automatically pull all of your messages as soon as published.) So it seems to be a weird strawman of a solution nobody would even try to use at large scale, or am I missing something ?? reply oDot 10 hours agoprevWhy not use ActivityPub? ActivityPub is a federated social networking technology popularized by Mastodon. Account portability is the major reason why we chose to build a separate protocol. We consider portability to be crucial because it protects users from sudden bans, server shutdowns, and policy disagreements. Our solution for portability requires both signed data repositories and DIDs, neither of which are easy to retrofit into ActivityPub. The migration tools for ActivityPub are comparatively limited; they require the original server to provide a redirect and cannot migrate the user's previous data. Other smaller differences include: a different viewpoint about how schemas should be handled, a preference for domain usernames over AP’s double-@ email usernames, and the goal of having large scale search and discovery (rather than the hashtag style of discovery that ActivityPub favors). from https://atproto.com/guides/faq reply aatd86 9 hours agoparentDomain usernames is a very good point. reply Diti 8 hours agorootparentUntil trademark laws come into play, and you find yourself obligated by law to give up your domain username to a big corporation.

Granted, my comment doesn’t add much to the discussion, since this domain ownership issue would have been a problem in ActivityPub too. reply neurostimulant 41 minutes agorootparentThis is not a problem because the atproto has true account portability, so your domain getting seized is not the end of the world, unlike in activitypub. reply madeofpalk 7 hours agorootparentprevSeems still better than the current status quo, where twitter can just decide to give your handle to kraft because they feel like it.

This wouldn't be a big deal in practice (besides losing the domain). Domain usernames are just the combo of you telling Bluesky \"I intend to use this domain name\" and then you placing a TXT record on the domain to prove you own it. If you want to change domains (or, are forced to), you just give them the new domain name and you set another TXT record (just like if you had set up a domain name as a username for the first time).

    "originLink": "https://n-skvortsov-1997.github.io/reviews/",
    "originBody": "V Language Review (2023) So you’ve found a new programming language called V. It looks nice, has a lot of promises on the website, nice syntax, but how does it really work? Everything described here is correct for the b66447cf11318d5499bd2d797b97b0b3d98c3063 commit. This is a summary of my experience with the language over 6 months + information that I found on Discord while I was writing this article. The article is quite long, because I tried to describe everything in as much detail as possible and anyone could reproduce the same behavior. Where do you start learning a new programming language? That’s right, from the documentation. V documentation is one huge docs.md file. Not far from the beginning, you can notice the built-in types that V has. The small soon prefix for types i128 and u128 describes the state of the entire language. This note has been in the documentation for at least 4 years (commit), apparently we need to wait a little longer. Next, you may notice that, unlike C and Go, int is always 32 bit. But, in release 0.4.3 it is now 64 bit on 64-bit systems and 32 bit on 32-bit systems. A couple of errors, you say, but no, this is the whole of V documentation. There are so few developers to keep the documentation in the correct state. Documentation often does not describe the most important parts of the language — for example, the section about generics consists of a couple of code examples without proper description. Promises as the following are also common in documentation: Currently, generic function definitions must declare their type parameters, but in the future V will infer generic type parameters from single-letter type names in runtime parameter types. And now you scroll down to the most interesting thing, memory management in V. In modern programming languages, this is almost the most important part of the language. What does V offer? First of all, this is “Garbage Collection”, a good option that greatly simplifies life, the second option “arena”, also a great option, “manual memory management” is also available for experienced programmers. The last and most interesting option is “autofree”. The first two options work relatively well, so let’s look at the last two. Manual memory management In this mode, libc’s malloc function is used for all allocations and the developer must clean up the memory himself. But what about the memory allocated inside standard library functions? Let’s take a look at the is_ascii method: @[inline] pub fn (s string) is_ascii() bool { return !s.bytes().any(itu8(`~`)) } It might seem like a small safe function, but if you call it with manual memory management, you will have leaks, since no one clears the memory allocated by the bytes() method. Here are more such examples. And this is only in string methods; in the standard library it is everywhere. Well, you can just not use these functions in your code. Let’s see what if you want a web server on V in “manual” mode. V has a built-in framework called vweb. The official examples include the following code: https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/examples/vweb/vweb_example.v. I’ve simplified it as much as possible: module main import vweb struct App { vweb.Context } pub fn (mut app App) index() vweb.Result { return app.text(\"Hello World\") } fn main() { vweb.run(&App{}, 8082) } Next arrays never deallocated in vweb code. This means that your application on vweb will have leaks. Well, not everyone writes web, maybe you need a simple CLI utility? Unfortunately, all string interpolations in the standard library for the CLI allocate memory then not cleaned up. From all of the above, I can draw the following conclusion: manual memory management in V is a feature that cannot be used in real applications. At most in simple programs where you write everything from scratch or memory leaks are not critical for you. autofree Now we come to the most interesting thing in this section. Let’s see how this mode is described in the documentation: The second way is autofree, it can be enabled with -autofree. It takes care of most objects (~90-100%): the compiler inserts necessary free calls automatically during compilation. Remaining small percentage of objects is freed via GC. The developer doesn’t need to change anything in their code. “It just works”, like in Python, Go, or Java, except there’s no heavy GC tracing everything or expensive RC for each object. Surprisingly, they were able to lie in every sentence. Let’s start from the very beginning, the documentation assures us that 90–100% will be cleaned up automatically using free calls inserted by the compiler. This sounds pretty optimistic, considering that to achieve the same thing in Rust, you need a lot of help to the compiler. The V compiler turns out to be “much smarter” than the Rust compiler. While I was looking at discussions in the language repository, I came across a interesting comment (link): In my v program, only 0.1% was autofreed and 99.9% was freed by the garbage collector. It all depends on the program you are making. The GC is still really fast though. But, let’s not take this as a fact and try it ourselves. Here’s the simplest code: module main struct Data { data []bool } fn main() { p := Data{ data: [true, false] } println(p.data) } Compile it using v -autofree main.v. And run valgrind: =653065= Memcheck, a memory error detector =653065= Copyright (C) 2002-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al. =653065= Using Valgrind-3.18.1 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info =653065= Command: /test =653065= [true, false] =653065= =653065= HEAP SUMMARY: =653065= in use at exit: 2 bytes in 1 blocks =653065= total heap usage: 6 allocs, 5 frees, 1,085 bytes allocated =653065= =653065= LEAK SUMMARY: =653065= definitely lost: 2 bytes in 1 blocks =653065= indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks =653065= possibly lost: 0 brtes in 0 blocks =653065= still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks =653065= suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks =653065= Rerun with --leak-check=full to see details of leaked memory =653065= =653065= ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0) Something went wrong. What’s also interesting is that we have a single array in the program, but valgrind shows that a 1kb of memory was allocated. Keep this point in mind as we move on to the website’s statement that V avoids unnecessary allocations. Let’s compile a simple example with a vweb server: module main import vweb struct App { vweb.Context } pub fn (mut app App) index() vweb.Result { return app.text(\"Hello World\") } fn main() { vweb.run(&App{}, 8082) } v -autofree server.v And let’s run it with valgrind.

Let’s return to the description from the documentation: Remaining small percentage of objects is freed via GC. And again it’s not true. I found a recent commit in which passing the -autofree flag immediately sets gc to none: '-autofree' { res.autofree = true + res.gc_mode = .no_gc res.build_options/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libatomic.so.1 (0x00007fc25455a000) libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fc254332000) /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fc25456e000) What about with -d use_openssl? ldd ./vweb_server linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc2b242000) libatomic.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libatomic.so.1 (0x00007fa673d80000) libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fa673b58000) libssl.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.3 (0x00007fa673ab4000) libcrypto.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.3 (0x00007fa673671000) /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fa673d94000) Hmm, as a result, the size is 5-17 times larger, and there are a lot of dependencies. Let’s go further. As fast as C (V’s main backend compiles to human readable C), with equivalent code. V does introduce some overhead for safety (such as array bounds checking, GC free), but these features can be disabled/bypassed when performance is more important. Just because you compile in C doesn’t mean you instantly get the same performance as handwritten C code. I have already shown above how V carelessly works with memory; not a single experienced C developer will make such mistakes. V can be as fast as C, but then a lot of things in the language cannot be used: string interpolation, interfaces, sum types, arrays and much more. C2V tool The official site says: V can translate your entire C project and offer you the safety, simplicity, and compilation speed-up (via modules). Sounds great, let’s try it. Before that, let’s pay attention on another statement: A blog post about translating DOOM will be published. You can find the same statement on the official website in 2020. Maybe we need to wait a little longer. During the article, I have already pointed out such moments several times; this is the distinctive feature of V, to promise and not to deliver. Well, let’s move on to c2v. Its repository can be found here: https://github.com/vlang/c2v It doesn’t have to be downloaded, it can be used via v translate. By the way, you will not find this command in v help: V supports the following commands: * Project Scaffolding Utilities: new Setup the file structure for a V project (in a sub folder). init Setup the file structure for an already existing V project. * Commonly Used Utilities: run Compile and run a V program. Delete the executable after the run. crun Compile and run a V program without deleting the executable. If you run the same program a second time, without changing the source files, V will just run the executable, without recompilation. Suitable for scripting. test Run all test files in the provided directory. fmt Format the V code provided. vet Report suspicious code constructs. doc Generate the documentation for a V module. vlib-docs Generate and open the documentation of all the vlib modules. repl Run the REPL. watch Re-compile/re-run a source file, each time it is changed. where Find and print the location of current project declarations. Did I mention that the documentation is bad? Let’s take a simple example: int foo(int a, int b); Let’s call the command v translate wrapper main.h and open the resulting file: [translated] module. fn C.foo(a int, b int) int pub fn foo(a int, b int) int { return C.foo(a, b) } Everything seems fine, but the module name is incorrect. In C libraries, constants are often defined using #define: #define VERSION 1.0 int foo(int a, int b); But as a result, c2v simply skips this constant, and it is not in the V code. The generated V code with #define fully equals to the code without it. Okay, let’s take a slightly more complicated example: #includetypedef struct { union { char *ptr; char small[16]; }; size_t size; } string; int foo(string str); This is a simple string implementation. [translated] module . struct Lldiv_t { quot i64 rem i64 } struct String { size usize } fn C.foo(str String) int pub fn foo(str String) int { return C.foo(str) } Wait a minute, what is this Lldiv_t and why is there only one field in the structure… I really like constancy: int foo(const int *const val); But c2v doesn’t: [translated] module . fn C.foo(val Int *const) int pub fn foo(val Int *const) int { return C.foo(val) } Absolutely incorrect code. You will say that I am making everything up and no one writes such code, okay, let’s take an example from real life. Let’s take the library that V uses for JSON: https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON. v translate wrapper cJSON.h Aaaaaand… Almost all is incorrect: fn C.cJSON_GetObjectItem(object CJSON *const, string_ Char *const) &CJSON pub fn cjson_getobjectitem(object CJSON *const, string_ Char *const) &CJSON { return C.cJSON_GetObjectItem(object, string_) } ... fn C.cJSON_IsTrue(item CJSON *const) CJSON_bool pub fn cjson_istrue(item CJSON *const) CJSON_bool { return C.cJSON_IsTrue(item) } ... fn C.cJSON_ReplaceItemViaPointer(parent CJSON *const, item CJSON *const, replacement &CJSON) CJSON_bool pub fn cjson_replaceitemviapointer(parent CJSON *const, item CJSON *const, replacement &CJSON) CJSON_bool { return C.cJSON_ReplaceItemViaPointer(parent, item, replacement) } Okay, let’s take another one, for example, backtrace.h. v translate wrapper backtrace.h Better, although we lost Backtrace_state and Uintptr_t and have an error: backtrace.v:29:59: error: unexpected token `&`, expecting name 27fn C.backtrace_print(state &Backtrace_state, skip int, &C.FILE) 2829pub fn backtrace_print(state &Backtrace_state, skip int, &C.FILE) { |^ 30C.backtrace_print(state, skip, &C.FILE) 31} Well, okay, c2v is not great with wrappers, but the tool can also translate entire C code into V. Let’s start with something simple: #includeint main(int argc, char **argv) { printf(\"%d\", argc); return 1; } Call c2v: v translate main.c Oops, where did argc go: [translated] module main fn main() { C.printf(c'%d', argc) return } I specifically returned 1 from main in the C code, but c2v ignored this and simply inserted return, thereby changing the behavior of the program. Let’s take something more complicated: #include#includevoid* my_malloc(size_t size) { void* ptr = malloc(size); if (ptr == NULL) { printf(\"malloc failed\"); exit(1); } return ptr; } int main(int argc, char **argv) { int *a = my_malloc(sizeof(int)); *a = 1; printf(\"%d\", *a); return 1; } V: [translated] module main struct Lldiv_t { quot i64 rem i64 } fn my_malloc(size usize) voidptr { ptr := C.malloc(size) if ptr == (unsafe { nil }) { C.printf(c'malloc failed') C.exit(1) } return ptr } fn main() { a := my_malloc(sizeof(int)) *a = 1 C.printf(c'%d', *a) return } It looks correct at first glance, but c2v has lost the fact that the result of my_malloc(...) is cast implicitly in int*. So if you have implicit casts in your code, then apparently everything will not work out of the box. But in C, implicit casts are rare, so it’s not a problem, right? We can talk about this for a long time; such simple examples already show how crude and unfinished this tool is. Considering the fact that it was announced and began development somewhere in 2020, the tool achieved such excellent success in just 3 years. Returning to the site: Powerful graphics libraries The following features are planned: Loading complex 3D objects with textures Camera (moving, looking around) Skeletal animation DirectX, Vulkan, and Metal support is planned. At least three years they promise what will happen. But the main thing is to promise, right? V UI Another project that showed promise, but something went wrong. Project repository: https://github.com/vlang/ui Over the last year, the project has had about 80 commits, of which a maximum of 10–20 are not fixes for the new version V. The project has been abandoned and is not being developed. But let’s see, in the readme we are greeted with an example: Do you know what’s interesting? If you go to repository from 2020 then the same picture will be there. The project has ROADMAP which was created in 2020, after 3 years only several points there were closed. You can say that perhaps developers spend all their time on the compiler, but at the same time, there are new projects like Education Platform, veery, vbrowser, heroesV. You may notice that all these projects start and are quickly abandoned. The same thing with V UI, but it lived a little longer, like the operating system on V, which was developed while there was a person with experience, as soon as he left, the project died. The V UI project description on the website says: V has a UI module that uses custom drawing, similar to Qt and Flutter, but with as much similarity to the native GUI toolkit as possible. Okay, let’s check the examples: I was able to copy the value in the password field without any problems, security is not a strong point of V UI: And these are official examples: It’s hard for me to say where the authors saw the maximum similarity with the native UI. The last part of this section sounds somewhat familiar: Coming soon: a Delphi-like visual editor for building native GUI apps iOS support Again, promises that are three years old. Coroutines Сoroutines in V. From the very beginning, V copied Go, and if it’s easy to copy the syntax, then to copy goroutines you need to have very mature and senior developers. Therefore, from the very beginning, V builds its multithreading on threads with all the disadvantages. But at some point the creator of the language thought, what’s stopping us from making coroutines. The coroutines were “done” in three commits: all: coroutines (part 1) all: coroutines (part 2) coroutines: init() that runs automatically With a difference of 4 hours, an impressive speed of implementation. Let’s see what kind of implementation coroutines have in V, stackless or stackful. The main implementation file is coroutines/coroutines.v. Wait a minute, this is not the implementation I expected: #flag -I @VEXEROOT/thirdparty/photon #flag @VEXEROOT/thirdparty/photon/photonwrapper.so #include \"photonwrapper.h\" fn C.photon_init_default() int fn C.photon_thread_create11(f voidptr) fn C.photon_sleep_s(n int) fn C.photon_sleep_ms(n int) // sleep is coroutine-safe version of time.sleep() pub fn sleep(duration time.Duration) { C.photon_sleep_ms(duration.milliseconds()) } What we see here are bindings for some third-party library. Here is the link to it: https://github.com/alibaba/PhotonLibOS. So, what we get is that coroutines in V are a 10-line wrapper over a third-party C++ library. Well, okay, in the examples there is code that will help us understand the strengths of coroutines simple_coroutines.v (or not). The whole example is a couple of loops with a sleep calls. Well, let’s try to build it: v -use-coroutines ./examples/coroutines/simple_coroutines.v coroutines .so not found, downloading... done! Um, it downloads a dynamic library from somewhere unknown, but okay. We get some output, but how do we understand that it is correct? The biggest difficulty of coroutines is context switching, that is, when one coroutine, for example, waits for a file to be read, and gives way to another coroutine. And here’s the problem: in V, the entire standard library is written in a synchronous manner. Let’s, for example, look at file read in V: pub fn read_file(path string) !string { ... nelements := int(C.fread(str, 1, allocate, fp)) ... } Here we see that V calls a C read function that reads a given number of bytes into the buffer. The problem is that read is a blocking function and the context will never be switched. One of the PhotonLibOS project maintainers says the same about this. The same goes for the network, V also uses the blocking API from C. And from this, it becomes clear that coroutines in V are not only a useless binding for a third-party lib, but also non-working as expected. Let’s see what their “author”, the creator of the language, says: https://discord.com/channels/592103645835821068/592106336838352923/1165748025377960037 https://discord.com/channels/592103645835821068/592106336838352923/1160886627208544308 https://discord.com/channels/592103645835821068/697813437237166131/1138567669323415562 https://discord.com/channels/592103645835821068/592320321995014154/1116015948038672414 https://discord.com/channels/592103645835821068/592106336838352923/1160744638529933463 He lies about the last missing coroutine feature, when the coroutines simply don’t work as expected. He lies that coroutines work with IO. I’ll clarify that by working, I personally mean context switching when necessary, and not the fact that the program does not crash. At the same time, nothing bothers him, and he is already planning to create a new framework for the web and publish links with headings about coroutines: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37174056 And most importantly, I only saw one person from the community who expressed the opinion that the current implementation of coroutines does not work. The rest of the core developers are apparently too busy to check the feature that comes first in CHANGELOG version 0.4: And all this without touching on the fact that the creator of the language forces the language to depend on a corporation that at any moment can simply stop supporting the library. If V integrates IO and network from this library to get context switches, then it will be even worse. V will depend on this corporation not only at the coroutine level, but even at the level of simple operations like reading a file or requests over the network. Moreover, this library only supports two main operating systems (Linux and macOS), which means that code with coroutines loses all the flexibility that V has thanks to the C compiler. Also, the author of the language doesn’t understand that you can’t just do two versions of functions, because when you call a function in a coroutine, the function for the coroutine must be used, and if outside the coroutine, the usual one. This library also does not fully support Windows, which means that V will only get coroutines on Windows if the authors of PhotonLibOS are so kind as to implement it. About the V community Community V is an interesting phenomenon. If you go to the V Discord server, you are unlikely to find criticism of V or the author of the language there. And do you know why? Because the author of the language bans people for their opinions. For example, I managed to “unsuccessfully” answer a person’s question in the V Telegram channel: For which I was immediately banned without explanation or attempt to show where I was wrong. Next, to my post on the Discord server where I described the situation, I received responses from several people, one said that everything is not so clear, and we don’t know the whole truth, and the second called me a troll. About an hour later, the author of the language deleted all messages after my post and banned me without explanation also in Discord. I want to clarify, this post has problems because I wrote it right after I was banned, and perhaps I could have been less arrogant: The creator of the language also called me a troll: Do you know why? Because he needed to justify himself to a person who directly stated that he did not approve of such behavior. Apologize? Admit mistake? No, this is not Alex’s way; his way is to dehumanize the victim by calling him a troll and banning anywhere. And you know what’s the funniest thing? Today this person was banned. Why? Because he disagrees with the policy for which I was banned the first time and asked to remove his article from vlang/education-platform. This was the only article with content, the other two consist of two phrases: “V is great.” and “In this lesson, we’ll examine one of the simplest codes in V.”, which were apparently written by Alex himself. Another lie, Alex himself wrote to me in Telegram, not the moderator. He told me that I could come to him in a private message in Telegram, and he would have unbanned me. Think about it, first he bans you on two platforms even though you didn’t break the rules, and then he says that you could come in private messages, and he would unban you. Unfortunately, I can’t provide a screenshot, since Alex deleted all the messages (familiar behavior, isn’t it?) that he wrote to me when he realized that I was not ready to humiliate myself. Today I was also banned for the third time, I created a specially new account to report that I was writing this article. And also to see how far Alex would go to try to shut me up. Well, the result of this is obvious, although today I was able to communicate with more people from the community than last time, and we even came to some kind of understanding. However, a few hours later Alex came and unceremoniously deleted all my messages and banned me. asvln’s messages were also deleted and he was banned. It is also interesting that after the messages were deleted, none of those with whom I spoke expressed disturbance about the deletion and bans, and here either they agree with Alex’s actions, or they just don’t care what is happening in their community, or they are simply afraid to speak out something against Alex, as this will lead to their ban. And each option is worse than the other. Apparently the author of the language does not understand that trying to shut people up will only cause more damage. This time I’m documenting everything carefully. Considering the fact that I have not seen criticism like this, all the brave souls here are banned. 3 years have passed, and nothing has changed, the author of other articles in which V is not praised as a divine creation was also banned. And this is not the last example, here is a person banned on Twitter for arguing with the author of the language. I’m almost sure that there were dozens, maybe hundreds of such cases. Do you want to be part of the community where banning for facts is ok, calling those who try to find out, compare or point out flaws as trolls is ok, and where the only correct opinion belongs to one person? Me not. I really want to see Alex’s Volt, which he promises people from 2019; apparently the main feature there will be the ability to ban people with the power of thought with automatic clearing of the chat. Beta was promised in May 2023, but something went wrong and the author of the language simply ignores people since then (another distinctive “feature” of Alex). As a result, the author of the language tried to shut me up, but got this article. I can already see how he is trying to justify himself by calling me a troll, a hater or something else, but whatever the reason for this article, all of the above are facts. Of course, the author of the language will say that these problems are easy to fix (good luck). After a “week” Alex will say that they are fixed, but this does not solve the global problems in the language, when problems are fixed only when they are pointed out. Developers are not interested in looking for bugs on their own. And this is obvious because, apart from the compiler, they do not develop large projects on V on which they could quickly find all these problems. Despite the fact that the language is almost 5 years old, you can still find very primitive problems that the language developers for some reason did not find before the users. The author of the language promises, as was the case with autofree, then postpones and promises again, and so on ad infinitum, how can one even trust such a person. This is where the article ends; only you can decide whether V is worth spending time on. In this article, I have only scratched the surface of V; to describe everything that V is bad at, I would need to write a book. I hope that this article will help you make the right decision. Bye.",

I don't think that's the full reason. I think part of the reason is that a lot of us want to believe something like V is possible, powerful safety features in a small conceptual and complexity footprint. So the first time we heard about V, we got excited, thinking maybe it could really be the cool thing it claims to be... No one likes false hope. It really stings, actually.

What's so special about V that you prefer using a literally broken language? (The perma memory leaks are basically enough already to qualify it as broken) Genuinely curious, I don't understand the point reply attractivechaos 15 hours agorootparentprevThe V devs have promised a lot, have missed a lot but have also achieved a lot. I have written a few short programs in V. IMHO, the V syntax is concise and intuitive and the performance is good. It is lightweight and easy to install and to use. The blog post is probably right that V has many rough edges but I would say the core features in V are well planned. I actually prefer it over some other more popular languages. That said, because V hasn't reached 1.0, it is probably too early to use it in production. reply bscphil 13 hours agorootparentYeah, when the article skipped over the first two memory management strategies to point out issues with manual memory management and an \"automatic\" strategy that is unfinished or broken, it really struck me that it's quite impressive for a single author to have a functional, fast language with a working garbage collector and arena allocator (with some issues) in only a few years. The criticisms in the article, which I just read beginning to end, are largely about features it claims to provide (or claims are in development) that either no other language has, are an improvement on other languages, or are state of the art features in world class languages with hundreds to thousands of times more developer hours. On the one hand, it's not wrong to criticize the overly ambitious nature of V's plans nor criticize the poor attitude and self-advertising strategies of its lead author. On the other hand, I'm not sure that the article is doing that, it seems much more interested in taking one of these features, showing that it doesn't work, and saying \"so there!\". But the fact that these are the features being complained about, not the core of the language, says something in itself. Likewise, the fact that a hobbyist language with a single primary developer has terrible documentation is at the very least par for the course. Heck, I've found the Zig documentation horrific (in the past), and that has way more developer time and mindshare. Compare it to, say, the Oil shell (at least, where it was a few years ago), if you want to be fair. I'm not convinced that the blog author isn't a troll, in some sense of the word. Clearly, many of their criticisms are well founded. Clearly, Alex does not react well to criticism. Clearly, V kinda sucks for practical use right now in a lot of ways that do matter. But the post (especially the end) feels like an excuse to stir the pot, not well-intentioned criticism. The author seems to want to use this post to counteract people they feel have mistreated them (with some justification). Note: I say all this as a complete outsider. I've never written a line of V code and probably never will. My only prior experience is that I'm familiar with the controversy around V, especially on this site. reply ptx 13 hours agorootparent> quite impressive for a single author to have a functional, fast language with a working garbage collector From what I gather from the article, they didn't implement a garbage collector, but rather integrated the Boehm GC. This is a conservative collector, so it doesn't collect all garbage. > But the fact that these are the features being complained about, not the core of the language, says something in itself. Memory management is a core part of a language. According to the article this core part doesn't work, which is a pretty big flaw. reply mort96 12 hours agorootparentprevThe problems with V has always been that its marketing is full of lies and its main selling points don't work as advertised. The same source code, but without the deception, might very well be an alright language. Just like how healing crystals are perfectly fine if what you want is decoration and you think they look pretty. It doesn't make the deceptive marketing okay. reply babel_ 12 hours agorootparentprev> it's quite impressive for a single author to have a functional, fast language with a working garbage collector and arena allocator (with some issues) in only a few years. As the included code shows, the gc is boehm gc, and checking their repo shows they just include libgc/bdwgc. This is absolutely not a knock against anyone here, it's just about the standard library for this need, and I think it is a far smarter move to use it than for most to attempt to make their own general-purpose gc (though boehm can't catch all leaks). I feel it would be wrong, however, to characterise this as being a single author having made a language with a gc and arenas, as if those were significant parts of the author's own developments, rather than using a well-picked import and a half-baked implementation of \"arenas\", which here are really just a global linked list of buffers, freed only at exit, and so everything leaks [0]. They're not really arenas, you can't use them locally in a region of code or as scratchpads, let alone multi-thread it. By their code's own admission, it's just a little pre-allocation to batch mallocs for all the little heap allocations of a GC-assuming codebase, so they're not really arenas like you'd use in C or elsewhere. Not unimpressive, it's a valid approach for some uses (though not general purpose), it's just different from a language with their own gc and actual arenas. Indeed, just implementing an arena barely even registers in the complexity, I feel, as arenas really should be very simple in most use cases [1]. It would be far more impressive to have them actually integrated and be available as a true alternative to a GC for memory management, particularly integrating common patterns (e.g. [2]) in a way that could serve as a drop-in replacement, such that we can actually provide bounded lifetimes and memory safety without a full GC, let alone support multiple concurrencies with it from multi-threading to coroutines -- this would likely still be unsafe without a GC compared to, say, Rust or Vale, let alone Pony or SPARK, and would likely require a cultural shift in manual management akin to Zig or Odin, as it may be largely moot if dependencies end up enforcing the gc themselves. Still, again, making anything substantial is never unimpressive, we just need to retain the perspective of what was achieved and how. As to the rest, well, I think it's fair to say that there should be a clear delineation between statements of \"we can do this and here's how\" and roadmaps with \"we're aiming to do these things and here's our current progress\". In my experience, people are quick to get these mixed up when they're excited about making something, and none of us are fully immune to this. It's not some moral failing or anything in and of itself, it can very easily be an honest mistake, but humans see patterns everywhere, so we often need to be receptive when others are trying to help us be level-headed and clear things up; otherwise a reputation begins to form. Especially in this industry, reproducibility matters, as we're all too familiar with the smoke-and-mirrors of demos (not to personally claim there is any here, just that it obviously helps dispel such concerns). And, of course, second chances are always offered if someone is willing to amend mistakes.

To the uninitiated this sounds like someone criticizing some kid’s side project. I’m picking up some context clues that V is widely used / famous / notable / significant somehow, but the only time I have ever heard of it before this is Xe Iaso’s similarly negative posts. Did V receive some huge funding grant that made it the target of ire? Is the author otherwise well-known? What am I missing? reply smcl 12 hours agoparentWhen the V project started out the creator of V made some big claims that raised a few eyeballs, they've gained a reasonable following over the years, have a pretty serious looking website (https://vlang.io), a beer-money level Patreon following and some corporate partnerships/sponsors. However they have experienced some pretty brutal takedowns over the years, with some of the bolder claims about the language/compiler often being exposed as untrue and some functionality being broken. A word I keep seeing in relation to V is \"aspirational\" - the project aspires to be a serious language and it aspires to have some serious features, so I think it's fair to approach it with a more critical eye than one would a kid's side-project. I think HN would have been pretty understanding if they were open about the state of the various features and were a little less defensive when they encounter articles that review it like a Real Language. If the authors don't want this kind of feedback they can just say front-and-centre (or on their FAQ @ https://github.com/vlang/v/wiki/FAQ) \"this is a toy\" or \"this is pre-alpha\" or \"this is for research purposes\". There are plenty of projects like this which are open about their intent and which don't have posts like this written about them. But I don't think that'll happen, so as it stands the pattern will continue - someone revisits the language every year or so, finds some things that doesn't meet expectations, writes about it and we discuss it on HN again. reply AndyKelley 12 hours agoparentprevThere is a summary at the top of this post from 2019: https://andrewkelley.me/post/why-donating-to-musl-libc-proje... reply andrewflnr 2 hours agoparentprev> To the uninitiated this sounds like someone criticizing some kid’s side project.

Hard to navigate, hard to find what you need if you don't already know what it's called and examples are extremely convoluted instead of showing you the basics barebones first.

I'd like to receive some criticism. reply arp242 16 hours agoprevA good faith look at V is that it's very much a work-in-progress, and that at times the documentation is \"aspirational\" rather than \"factual\". I'm reminded by an remark from Bill Joy in an old interview talking about writing vi: \"I wrote manual pages for all the great features we were going to do but never implemented\".[1] We've all done that, right? I certainly have, including in public projects. There's a lot to be said about the wisdom of publishing material like this, and it's fine to object. But phrasings like \"they were able to lie in every sentence\" do not sit well with me, especially since the bit that follows doesn't actually disprove the claims all that well. It's assuming the worst possible motivation (intentional deception) rather than the much more likely motivation (small team, tad too much enthusiasm, and perhaps at times, inexperience). I'm not entirely trusting the objectivity of an author who describes these sort of things as \"lies\". Even worse are things like: > He lies that coroutines work with IO. I’ll clarify that by working, I personally mean context switching when necessary, and not the fact that the program does not crash. So the functionality is correct, but not in a way the author would like it to, therefore it's a lie to claim it works. Eh? It's fine to criticize that the implementation isn't any good, of course, but employing such narrow definition of \"works\" and then calling someone a \"liar\" over it seems rather, eh, much. In short: not a fan. I'm not saying the V people have always smelled of roses either, but this article is definitely part of the problem with the general drama and toxicity surrounding V.

The problems they claim to solve look deceptively easy on the surface. Something like escape analysis (required for automatic borrowing without GC or refcounting) has many easy cases, but also incredibly hard or literally unsolvable edge cases. They may have been encouraged by progress on the easy cases, and assumed the rest is just a matter of a few bug fixes, rather than hitting the halting problem. reply nazgulsenpai 15 hours agoparentprevI agree with this perspective, in theory. Not liking how something is implemented is different than suggesting it isn't implemented. The real damning aspect of this is that criticism surrounding these decisions seems to result in the silencing of the critic. There are times where moderation and banning are necessary, such as when the critic resorts to name calling or trolling. Criticism can lead to more awareness which could lead to a better implementation down the pike, even if there's alot of headbutting in the process. Outright silencing the dissent is counterproductive. I also don't think reporting about being banned/silenced for such criticism is perpetuating the drama/toxicity of the community for the sake of it when it's a real world outcome. reply arp242 14 hours agorootparentI've seen this play out a few times now in a few different communities: systemd, Gnome/GTK, wider JavaScript and PHP communities, and probably some others. There is legitimate reasonable criticism of these things, even today. However, they have also been subject to profoundly unreasonable – even unhinged – criticism, and this has created a rather unhealthy dynamic where both reasonable and unreasonable criticism are all treated the same by the developers. You kind of need to insulate yourself to some degree. For example, consider my write-up of the \"GTK thumbnail issue\" at [1] (I since deleted my account there, but that was written by me). It's easy to come off with a bad impression of the Gnome/GTK developers based on that, but at the same time ... they've been subject to so much unreasonable whining and criticism that it has also created this dynamic. There's tons of examples like this. Also see: every time GIMP comes up on HN, with people ranting and whining about all sorts of things.

    "originLink": "https://dansalva.to/coding-the-anime-woosh-screen-on-amiga/",
    "originBody": "Coding the anime \"woosh\" screen on Amiga February 23, 2024 The Amiga was a spectacle of graphics and sound when it debuted in 1985. While it can trivially display colorful images like in the above example, doing so in the context of a game engine presents a lot of unique challenges. If you haven't seen the gameplay proof-of-concept video for Magicore Anomala, you can check it out here. Challenge 1: The RAM requirements A run-of-the-mill Amiga 500 has 512kb of \"Chip RAM\" and 512kb of expansion RAM (sometimes called \"Slow RAM\"), which is the platform target for Magicore. Only Chip RAM can be used by the Amiga chipset to present graphics and sound, which makes it much more valuable—all other kinds of expansion RAM can only be accessed by the CPU. The fullscreen character graphic (CG) is a 320x240 bitmap with 32 colors, which takes up 48kb of RAM uncompressed. That is a lot. Between all the common assets, level data, and screen memory allocations, we don't want to afford that kind of overhead on the RAM. Thankfully, I recently added support for asset compression, using the ZX0 compression format. Compressed, the CG is about 8kb, which is acceptable. When the level assets are loaded, the compressed CG is loaded into the expansion RAM. Then, right before it gets displayed, I unpack it into Chip RAM. The trick is that instead of finding 48kb of free Chip RAM to use, I reuse other parts of screen memory: The room background image (the grassy field, in this example) The screen layer used to render hazardous objects (not shown in the video) The textbox screen area (as seen in the gameplay proof-of-concept video) All three of these memory regions are contiguous in RAM, and they come out to 48,000 bytes, which is the exact size of the CG! It's also okay to overwrite the room background image, because we can restore it after the CG is done being displayed. In the video below, I force the CG to always be shown on the screen, so we can watch how the data gets decompressed and overwritten. Pretty cool, right? As you can see, the CG takes maybe 500ms to fully decompress. But that \"loading time\" is hidden into the flow of the cutscene. Challenge 2: The \"screen split\" effect I was initially thinking about doing a vertical wipe for the screen transition. But for that to look nice, the wipe would have to be a gradient, adjusting the color palette every scanline. That's pretty possible, but the coprocessor (copper) alone struggles to set all 32 colors in a single horizontal blank, and—I'll be honest—I didn't want to deal with \"racing the beam\". The screen split effect is easier to pull off, and I think it looks cooler to the common viewer. In fact, the copper was practically purpose-designed for this effect! Check out this video, which demonstrates a similar effect built right into Amiga Workbench. This demonstrates two special features of Amiga working in tandem: The copper runs in parallel to the CPU with its own instruction list. Those instructions can tell it to change certain hardware registers at specific lines on the screen. The screen memory can be changed to anywhere in Chip RAM by setting screen pointers in the hardware registers. That means you can have multiple bitmap screens and switch between them whenever you want—every frame (e.g. for double buffering), or even multiple times in one frame. Let's say my \"main\" screen memory begins at 0x20000. Normally, I instruct the copper to arm the bitplane DMA registers with this address. Once I enable the bitplanes, the DMA happily marches through this region of memory, drawing its data to the screen while incrementing the address pointer as it goes. There is an interesting trick. Let's say each horizontal line takes up 0x100 bytes of screen memory. What if I set the screen pointer to 0x20800 instead? The screen will appear to \"scroll up\" by 8 lines, because the screen officially starts 8 lines down into memory. I have the top half of the split scroll up in this fashion. Then, at the split point, the copper is instructed to shut off bitplane DMA (and change the BG color to red). Now, all the bitplane-related hardware registers are effectively frozen in time. Once we reach the bottom of the split, the copper resets the BG color and resumes bitplane DMA. The display picks up right where it left off, just lower down on the screen! If you're wondering what this looks like, here is the copperlist used for the effect: vs_TCop: ; Wait for top split to end vs_TCopTop: dc.w $9007,$fffe ; Set BG color vs_TCopColorTop: dc.w COLOR00,0 ; Disable sprite and bitplane DMA dc.w DMACON,$0120 ; Wait for bottom split to start vs_TCopBottom: dc.w $90e1,$fffe ; Restore BG color vs_TCopColorOld: dc.w COLOR00,0 ; Enable sprite and bitplane DMA dc.w DMACON,$8120 That's it! Every frame, I use the CPU to adjust vs_TCopTop and vs_TCopBottom based on the current width of the split. (Not shown: Adjusting the screen pointer for the top split, as described above.) Challenge 3: The \"motion lines\" You can't reach full anime without having the lines that go \"woosh\" in the background. I use sprites to draw the lines, which is a good choice because they can be drawn and moved fully independently from screen memory. The issue is that Amiga sprites are both very limited and very complicated. Sprite colors Sprites share a color palette with bitplanes, meaning I want to use up as few colors as possible. The sprite is only 3 colors, leaving 28 for the CG (and 1 for the background). The problem is that different sprites use different colors in the palette. The first two sprites use colors 16-19, the second two sprites use colors 20-23, and so on. This changes if you combine sprites. By \"attaching\" two sprites together, they become one sprite with a 16-color palette (colors 16-31). That means for the motion lines, I can use 4 attached sprites, and use only colors 29-31 in the graphic. It's a silly workaround for a silly limitation. Reusing a sprite graphic The first 4 bytes of a sprite graphic are actually \"control bits\" that tell the Amiga the position and height of the sprite. That is actually a pain—what if we want to draw the same graphic in multiple locations? My first thought was to manually set the hardware registers for sprite control bits, but I simply could not get the sprite to display on screen when doing this. Amiga sprite DMA works similarly to bitplane DMA; it has a pointer to the sprite data that it walks through in order to display it to the screen. But when manually setting the control bits, I just couldn't get it to do that. I'm sure it can be done, but I decided to find another way. I instead created 8 fake sprites that are only 4 bytes large—just the control bits. I set all the sprite pointers to those fake sprites. Around line 19, the sprite DMA looks at all the sprite pointers and arms itself with the control bits, preparing to draw the data to the screen at the specified position. Once it does so, I pull a switcheroo: I change all the sprite pointers to the \"motion line\" graphic. Now, the DMA is armed to draw all the sprites at different positions, but using the same graphic. Again, this can be trivially done in the copperlist: ; Set dummy sprite pointers (to arm control bits) vs_CopSprP: COPPTR SPR0PT COPPTR SPR1PT COPPTR SPR2PT COPPTR SPR3PT COPPTR SPR4PT COPPTR SPR5PT COPPTR SPR6PT COPPTR SPR7PT ; Wait for line 19 dc.w $14df,$fffe ; Now that control bits are armed, set data pointers vs_CopSprP2: COPPTR SPR0PT COPPTR SPR1PT COPPTR SPR2PT COPPTR SPR3PT COPPTR SPR4PT COPPTR SPR5PT COPPTR SPR6PT COPPTR SPR7PT Sprites don't get drawn when bitplanes are off Before the CG reaches the top of the screen, there is a bunch of empty space between the top of the screen and the start of the CG. If bitplanes are enabled during this time, they will draw junk data to the screen. Here is an example of that: Dang, that's actually kind of cool-looking. Missed opportunity? In that screen region, we want to disable bitplanes so that the DMA doesn't run away with junk data like that. One problem: If you disable bitplanes, then sprites also don't get drawn! I don't know why it works like this, but it does. See how the lines only get drawn within the bounds of the CG? My solution was to keep just 1 bitplane enabled, and set the screen pointer to empty data. That way, it is drawing to the screen, but it's just drawing nothing. But where do I find a screen full of empty data? Thankfully, I don't have to. There are \"bitplane modulo\" registers (BPLMOD1 and BPLMOD2) that let you increment the screen pointer by a certain amount after each line. This is useful for interleaved bitplanes, which I won't get into here. At 1 bit per pixel, a 320-pixel line is 320 bits, or 40 bytes. If I set BPLMOD1 to -40, then it will go backwards 40 bytes after each line, causing it to draw the same 40 bytes over and over, on each new line. That means I only need to find 40 bytes of empty data, which is easy to find; my screen has \"safety margins\" which hold nothing but junk data from objects that are drawn beyond the screen borders. I can just clear out the first 40 bytes of the safety margin, and I'm good to go. Conclusion I originally wasn't sure if I would include CGs like this in the game, because I was worried about the RAM requirements. But now that I have data compression implemented, I proved that the overhead is extremely reasonable, and I can add this extra bit of flair to Magicore. There were a lot of other small challenges I didn't go over here, like getting the bottom of the 100px motion line to not abruptly disappear after the sprite leaves the top of the screen. But the ones I covered were the most interesting to me, especially how they involve unique quirks of Amiga hardware. Also, if you like Amiga, you might have noticed that this effect doesn't use the blitter at all! If you want to read a blitter-related post, try this one. Amiga is so great at displaying colorful graphics that I hope I can impress people with its capabilities today, just as they were in the latter half of the 80s. Apple Vision Pro and ADHD",

I've went through the trouble to acquire a Commodore 64, recap it, and install some third-party modifications (needed to replace the PLA, but also added a mod for dual SID and a \"region switch\" - the region switch one is quite involved since it needs two VIC-IIs and two oscillators you can switch between.) Not the only computer I have enjoyed digging into: I have an MSX2 as well that I find very charming, though I haven't done a whole lot. The one thing I will say is that finding time to actually try to write code for these machines is hard :) But I imagine it's just simply a matter of devoting some nights and weekends to it when inspiration strikes, not unlike most hobby work done by people who have day jobs. I think retrocomputing is a fantastic hobby that is fascinating and rewarding. If I had one complaint, it would not actually be the amount of time it takes, it's honestly the price and difficulty in acquiring components. Seems like a lot of people have cashed in on anything that is \"antique\" or \"vintage\" in the computer market and hope for large returns. This is a shame. As for older folks, I can't speak to it directly. But it certainly seems that some of the folks who are still writing Commodore 64 demos are doing so in large part to reconnect with their childhood. Possibly one of the most obvious artifacts of this are demos that pretty much tell a story as such, like the relatively recent demo \"Mojo\" by Bonzai and Pretzel Logic[1]. And obviously, attempting to do \"serious\" story telling in something like a demoscene production is a bit corny, but I find it very endearing in spite of that, so I'm glad they're doing it. In any case, it's a hobby that takes a lot of time... but I guess if you want to find time that badly, you find ways.

Not surprisingly given the shear hardware differences. Amiga really was an everything and the kitchen sink system. High end 32bit CPU, graphics acceleration, amazing audio, literally 256 times the ram of the NES. Even the SNES didn't come close. Wasn't until the Sega Saturn era that we saw something that could outperform it. reply dansalvato 11 hours agorootparentAmiga has its strengths, but I find that the SNES outperforms it in video games, because the SNES graphics chips were designed for video games first and foremost. One major reason is sprites: Amiga can display 8 4-color sprites, or 4 16-color sprites, and the colors are shared with the bitplanes. SNES can display 128 16-color sprites, and the sprites get 8 palettes all to themselves. This leads to much more colorful-looking visuals on SNES. Since Amiga is all bitplanes, enabling more colors and higher resolution results in a massive performance hit. Most game entities would need to be blit on top of the background, and then the background \"restored\" every frame that entity moves. SNES' native support for multiple tile layers and good sprites means that the CPU can do a lot less work to achieve a lot more. Amiga can do some very cool stuff that SNES can't, especially with the blitter, but SNES is much more practical and powerful for video games. reply vardump 9 hours agorootparent\"One major reason is sprites: Amiga can display 8 4-color sprites, or 4 16-color sprites, and the colors are shared with the bitplanes.\" Per scanline.

Assuming you are not rewriting the palette scanline-by-scanline... Amiga is stuck with 16 colors for the whole bitmap screen unless extra-halfbrite mode is used, then it goes up to 32 colors (extra colors must be half as bright as the base colors). Using the hardware sprites (3 colors + transparent) can add up to 12 more colors. Meanwhile on the SNES, the most-used video mode has two background layers with 15-color tiles (plus transparent), and one background layer with 3-color tiles (plus transparent). 8 different palettes can be selected, for 128 colors. Then there are sprites too, lots of sprites can be on the screen at once. 15-colors (plus transparent) for a sprite, and 8 different palettes can be selected. Then afterwards, color math can be applied, you can make graphics use additive blending (light effects), subtractive blending (darkness effects), or 50% transparent blending. reply frostburg 27 minutes agorootparentAs is was already noted, scanline-level techniques were commonly used in Amiga games. A few of the more sophisticated efforts could be argued to be technically superior to anything on the SNES; consider Shadow of the Beast 3 or Lionheart. reply stormking 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's 32 colors in normal and 64 colors in extra-halfbrite. reply vidarh 8 hours agorootparentprev32/64 colours, assuming no rewriting, but given the very existence of the copper was motivated by being able to change values like that, plenty of Amiga games exceeded that. Some very substantially. The copper was also used to multiplex sprites, so again the limitation is per scanline. And assuming things wouldn't be changed per scanline is assuming a shoddy job - very few games on the Amiga would not make at least some use of the copper to extend the number of sprites or number of colours on screen. reply lttlrck 6 hours agorootparentI have very vague memories from the time when Lemmimgs was released, something about the sprite/copper that allowed it to display those Lemmings efficiently. Of course the Atari ST had the exactly same game which puzzled me, though presumably it used brute force. reply vidarh 1 hour agorootparentI think it's more likely it \"just\" had more colours, and possibly used a different graphics mode for parts of the screen. Lemmings strikes me as a game where the size and number both precludes using sprites for all of them, and where moving the Lemmings themselves shouldn't be computationally costly enough to be a problem. Though the Amiga does allow changing the positioning of the screen over a larger bitmap, so e.g. panning the levels without much/any copying might have been an option? Doesn't require the copper, though. reply soegaard 11 hours agoparentprev [–] Just checking - you are aware this is a new game under development? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SB20aFHc08 reply layer8 10 hours agorootparent [–] Adobe might sue for that weapon at 3:13. ;) reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Ledger. Tavis Ormandy $Id: f0cc50a6fc6a5dd652c2b96ca9c1779f763fd6b1 $ Intro Getting Started Examples Advice Intro One of my new years resolutions was to commit to using ledger – a commandline accounting tool. Ledger is a bit like Quicken, GnuCash or Mint, but for UNIX nerds. Note: No relation to the cr*pto product with the same name. It’s coming up to the end of the year, and this was one of the few resolutions I actually managed to keep! I think you can probably accomplish everything ledger can do with other personal finance software. The reason you would choose ledger is that you’re sold on the efficiency and scriptability of the commandline, along with the grep, editor and revision control friendly file format. If that sounds interesting, go take a look at the docs to learn more! The TL;DR is that I’m hooked, and will keep using it. Getting Started It’s not easy to get started with ledger, and you’re probably going to have some uncommon financial arrangements that the documentation didn’t cover exactly. It could be anything, maybe something mundane like you split the utilities with a partner, but you’re the one who pays the bill?1 These things are easy to handle once you’re familiar with ledger concepts, but as nobody has the exact same arrangements as you, it’s not always a copy-and-paste situation. This is where ledger’s flexibility can be a curse – the answer to questions like “How do I handle …?” tends to be “However you like!”. Cool, but you’re not going to have any opinions formed yet, so how do you know what you like? I don’t really have a good solution – I think you just have to wing it until you’re proficient, then go back and fix any naive mistakes you made 🙈 Another problem is that you need a few months worth of data before you can fairly evaluate if you find it useful or not. That’s a big commitment to something that you’re not sure you’re actually going to enjoy! After you’ve finally built up some data… your reward is having to learn the query syntax so you can actually do something useful with it… and that’s when you’ll realize you didn’t organize things optimally, and have to go back and edit the last few months of data! 😂 Now that I’ve scared everyone off, I can tell you I don’t regret that effort – ledger is great! You know that feeling when you find a solution that just feels “correct”? Well, ledger gives me that feeling. Examples So, what exactly does ledger look like? Well, there is no user interface, it’s a commandline tool to query your finances. Note: If you want graphs, you pipe the output into gnuplot, like this. If you’re a stats nerd, you might prefer ledger-plots. You can automatically import transactions from whatever format your bank provides, but I prefer to enter some transactions manually. I use vim’s colorcolumn feature to make margins and keep everything neatly aligned. Once you’ve got importing and editing working smoothly, you can start answering questions about your finances. How much have I spent this month? $ ledger bal --period \"this month\" ^Expenses: How much did I spend on gas each month this year? $ ledger reg --period \"this year\" --monthly ^Expenses:Auto:Gas What is my current networth? $ ledger bal --depth 1 --market ^Assets: ^Liabilities: How much have my investments grown? $ ledger bal --gain ^Assets:Brokerage Okay, but what about my investment in stock FOOBAR specifically? $ ledger bal --gain --limit 'commodity == \"FOOBAR\"' ^Assets:Brokerage Okay, but how much of that is long term capital gains? $ ledger bal --gain --limit 'commodity == \"FOOBAR\"' --limit 'lot_date(amount)20' ^Expenses: Did I earn enough credit card rewards to justify the fees, or should I cancel them? $ ledger reg --period \"this year\" --subtotal --related ^Income:Reward Show me all the donations I made that I can deduct on my taxes? $ ledger reg --period \"this year\" %deductible These are just some random examples, there are also budgeting and forecasting tools. It’s flexible enough that people use it for tracking billable hours, inventory and so on. Naturally, it handles multiple currencies, arbitrary commodities, and you can track them as precisely (or coarsely) as you like. Advice This post is really just encouraging anyone considering getting started to take the leap if you were thinking about getting started in the new year! fyi, you could probably record that like this: ; Pay the power bill, John owes me half 2023/10/1 * Power Company Expenses:Utilities:Power $50 Assets:Receivables:John $50 Assets:Checking -$100 ; John reimbursed me. 2023/10/2 * John Doe ; Flatmate Assets:Checking $50 Assets:Receivables:John -$50 …but maybe you want to record it like this: ; Pay the power bill, John owes me half 2023/10/1 * Power Company Expenses:Utilities:Power $100 Assets:Checking $100 ; John reimbursed me his half. 2023/10/2 * John Doe ; Flatmate Assets:Checking $50 Expenses:Utilities:Power -$50 ; [=2023/10/1] There is not always one right answer!↩︎ HOME • ABOUT • CONTACT",

For many years I suffered through QuickBooks because I just assumed that was the Only Way. The single biggest pain point (and it's hard to pick just one) is that QuickBooks makes it absolutely mind-numbingly difficult to bulk-change any entries in your ledger -- if you categorize 1000 items one way and your accountant later tells you to recategorize them, there is NO WAY (or at least there was no way when I did this in the early 2000s) to bulk recategorize items. So I remember the pain of having to manually change thousands of entries or, worse, doing indecipherable things like making single journal entries like \"moving from X category to Y category\". Discovering ledger was a breath of fresh air because the source data is just text! If you need to change data or recategorize or make any tweaks whatsoever you have the entire world of text manipulation tools at hand. You can write shell scripts and use IDEs (and believe it or not Github Copilot works REALLY well). It's just amazing to realize that the perfect accounting solution has been there the whole time and is vastly vastly SIMPLER than I ever imagined. I went through all the SaaS tools (Xero, etc.) and nothing felt right. Ledger just works and feels right. reply curun1r 6 hours agoparent> I suffered through Quickbooks because I just assumed that was the Only Way Suffering through QuickBooks is literally a product feature. Like, when they were porting it to the online version, bookkeepers got upset that the web version didn’t have many of the frustrating quirks of the desktop version that they’d spent decades learning to deal with. They see their having learned the bizarre ins and outs of the software as a moat that keeps their clients from doing their books themselves, so many/most require their clients to use it.

Some notes: - The initial setup of the books is pretty time consuming especially if you have a lot of accounts. I recommend starting your most important accounts and adding as you go along. - Mass changing categories is just a search and replace so I have been getting pretty fine grained with the categories as I go along. - Being a small business the separation from business and personal is needed from a legal standpoint, but from a practical standpoint I live off an owner’s draw and a put cash into the LLC when investing in its growth. Having hledger have all my accounts, personal and business and being able to filter out appropriate reports has been great for seeing things like is the business a money pit or am I actually growing wealth over time. - I combine hledger csv output with Jupyter to generate the specific reports and charts I need. I.e business specific versus combined for taxes. This filtering also has me thinking of other ideas like figuring out which credit cards to apply for based on my expenses. Overall more fine tuned than what I have been able to achieve with Quickbooks over 8 years. reply thisisthenewme 14 hours agoprevI recently started using Ledger this year, and I've been really impressed with its utility for me. I think, for my personal needs, https://pypi.org/project/ledger-autosync/ is a must-have. I don't want create my own transactions, and with the autosync extension, I can simply export my bank transactions as QFX files and then import them into my ledger file. In the past, I struggled to accurately track my spending, and typical banking apps were either slow or lacked good querying capabilities. Now, I can easily budget, track purchases, calculate my worth across multiple accounts, and more. I guess similar results might be possible with other accounting tool but Ledger perfectly meets my requirements.

A question to other (possibly European) Ledger users: have you ever considered this a hindrance or inconsistency regarding your use of the software? I've been using Ledger for almost a decade (tiny single-person \"company\"). At one point, though, I started migrating my stuff to PTA by OpenBSD dev Ingo Schwarze [2]. It is a small Perl utility and relies on the numbered accounts system in a separate file, so I do feel more on the same page with general accounting-related discussions and corner-case howtos in my country. I also like how PTA's reliance on account numbers also allows for a single-line oriented, very compact journal format [3]. This is great for further parsing with Unix tools. There was interesting discussion on PTA vs Ledger etc involving the author [4].FWIW, PTA is also linked on the plaintextaccounting.org website To be fair, because of little prior experience with accounting in general, I did somewhat mess up my initial system of accounts in Ledger. So the migration to PTA is also in a standstill at this point. But it is a nice system for people in countries where the numbered chart of accounts might be preferred. My only complaint is, the author might have written it in something as tiny and easily portable like Awk instead (for us occasional Windows users). But Perl, despite being \"huge\" in this comparison, is included in the OpenBSD base, and it is praised for text parsing, so the preference is understandable. 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_of_accounts 2: https://mandoc.bsd.lv/pta/ 3: https://cvsweb.bsd.lv/~checkout~/pta/journal.example.en 4: https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20200928123430 reply lvass 15 hours agoprevI think all these tutorials and showcases showing CLI usage for plaintext accounting kinda miss the mark and ultimately hinders adoption. 99% of the times I interact with ledger is with the same 4 commands.

This [ledger's approach] totally breaks the ability to break different transaction types into different files and then import all files into a master file. reply lvass 12 hours agorootparentYou can get this behavior with --sort d in argument or ledgerrc or setting LEDGER_SORT=d in your environment. Or merge files sorted by date with ledger -f file1 -f file2 --sort d print. I agree the default sorting is quite jarring, but practically every single time if some entry is out of place chronologically, for me it's because I input-ed the wrong date and the default sort makes more sense. The reason I have hledger installed is for check ordereddates. reply lvass 16 hours agoparentprevMy ledger file works in both ledger and hledger, I tend to mostly use ledger as it's worked better within emacs for me.

My 100-level accounting instructor summarized it as: \"A debit is the entry in the left column, and a credit is an entry in the right column.\" Without the context of the specific accounts being debited or credited the terms themselves don't confer significant meaning. A basic knowledge of bookkeeping and accounting terminology can confer near \"super powers\" when it comes to dealing with finance people. It's easy to learn and worth the time. Double-entry bookkeeping is one of the oldest and longest-practiced \"IT\" disciplines. Your work probably touches revenue / expenses for your employer and someday you'll need to interface with accounting or finance people. Being able to speak the language, even poorly, has helped me gain trust and credibility that I don't believe speaking only in IT terms would have. reply beej71 11 hours agorootparentLedger kind of side steps this \"debit\" and \"credit\" issue by just using positive and negative numbers to add to or subtract from a particular account.

I think you'll want to edit that. reply projektfu 14 hours agorootparentI think in the US we usually call Capital \"Equity\", so it's Assets = Liabilities + Equity Or net assets = equity. The corollary for an accounting period Assets + Expenses = Liabilities + Equity + Income is more interesting. We say that the left side has a debit balance and the right side has a credit balance. It's easy to see how a few transactions work. Pay a bill from checking, debit Expenses, credit Assets. Buy something on credit card, debit Expenses, credit Liabilities. Pay credit card, credit Assets, debit Liabilities. Receive a payment for services, debit Assets, credit Income. To close the accounts for the period, credit total Expenses to 0, debit Equity by that amount, and debit total Income to 0 and credit Equity by that amount. Naturally, things are kept in subaccounts but this is the overall effect on the accounting equation. reply nyrikki 15 hours agorootparentprevAre you complaining about the order of the C and L terms?

I never knew why they insisted on that but now I do. reply wrycoder 14 hours agorootparentIt's standard for accounts that normally maintain a debit balance be on the left side, and accounts that maintain a credit balance be on the right. So, the usual accounting equation is written: assets = liabilities + capital Yes, capital is similar to liabilities. It is owed to the investors (which may just be an individual). The full equation prior to closing the books for a period is: assets + expenses = liabilities + income + capital For an individual, 'capital' is usually called 'net worth'. Once the books close, (income - expenses) is moved to capital as 'retained earnings'. In traditional, hand entered debit/credit accounting, the left hand side adds up to the same number as the right hand side. The books are balanced - the accounts on the left 'weigh' the same as the ones on the right. In computerized accounting, the left hand side (debit) accounts are normally positive and the right hand side (credit) accounts are normally negative. There is no equation - all the accounts add up to zero, and every double entry transaction adds up to zero. reply rwbt 15 hours agoprevI've been using hledger[1] - similar tool but has more features like balance sheet, income statement generation with a plain text file for the last 3 years and it's been working out great.

Here's my workflow: Everytime I make a transaction, I put a note on my phone. The note is a simplified version of hledger file format. Example: 24feb 12.5 cash food eating out at xx 6.5 bank1 phonebill 25feb ... and so on. As you can see, each block is started with the date, and each line corresponds to a journal entry. In each entry, the first item is the dollar amount, the 2nd item is the credited account, the 3rd item is the debited account, and the rest will be taken as the entry description. Every week end, I will parse this note with a Python script that I wrote, and put the output in the actual journal file. The shorthand account names in the note will be converted into actual account name (e.g. 'bank1' to 'assets:bank:bank1'), based on a dictionary file. I'd then proceed to manually check that all ending balances in hledger match with the actual amount in the real world. (It's pretty satisfying to see the numbers match.)

    "originBody": "How To Not Die By A Thousand Cuts. Or, How To Think About Software Quality. ↑ menu ↓ discuss ↓ toc Not a weighty meandering 300 page Zen dialogue on Motorcycle Maintenance. Merely a meandering blog post in which one contemplates /Quality/ of software products. By: Adi Published: 2022-01-20 Updated: 2023-03-10 Tags: / #quality / #risk / #systems Contents What is the nature of software products? Whom to hold responsible for Software Quality Assurance? Why? Is it different for different kinds of products? How to destroy Quality? How to create Quality? The first skill is to learn to suffer constructively. Caveats, mea culpa, etc. First off, what even is Quality? All things emerge, change, and die. I think Quality is the experience of the process. The idea of Good Quality essentially boils down to performing the process with grace, and leaving the place better than we found it. Further, the process of emergence and change—i.e. living—is also the process of dying. It follows that to think clearly about the Quality of the former one must think clearly about the Quality of the latter. The saddest way it can unfold is a slow painful degradation without healing succour meaning or hope. The proverbial death by a thousand cuts. I hope you never witness such a passing, even from afar. Ok, that got dark fast, and if we're not careful, we will produce a 300 page Zen dialogue on Motorcycle Maintenance. So we will distract ourselves with the much smaller, lighter—and I'd argue, even pleasant—task of contemplating Quality of software products. None of what follows is novel, but I feel the message and its surrounding context bears repeating, because if it is not obvious already, software fails us all the time. Far too often with terrible consequences. What is the nature of software products? See? This is already easier than asking \"What is the nature of life?\". Like any other machine, a software product is wrought of the labour of many minds and hands, and it requires maintenance and upkeep throughout its life. Unlike all other machines, it is pure concept, and as such it is infinitely malleable and mutable. And mutate it does, all the time. Sometimes, \"finished\" software emerges, only needing minor fixes and patches, but remaining the same in purpose, interface, and behaviour. Many Unix tools fall in this category. Some projects like ZeroMQ make it their explicit goal. Many Clojure programmers value such \"finished-ness\". Such scattered examples exist. Most software does not have this luxury. Most software must change indefinitely because the world it must serve changes indefinitely. The Emacs editor is a software product that has evolved non-stop for nearly half a century since it emerged in 1976, and it continues to thrive. This post was written in Emacs. There is a strong reinforcing feedback loop too. Software changes the world fast, forcing software to change faster. The current reincarnation of Machine Learning and AI can be viewed as an expression of this process. We're basically saying it's all accelerating so much that it is getting humanly impossible to write and revise software fast enough, to out-OODA the pace of change. So we must instead find algorithms that sense the world and then dynamically generate or revise other algorithms to achieve system objectives (viz. alter the world further in our favour). We have to wonder, how do we make sure our product continues to thrive and succeed under such unrelenting pressure of constant and sometimes violent change? And who's neck should be on the line for it? Whom to hold responsible for Software Quality Assurance? The Usual Suspects? Those \"Quality Assurance\" boffins? Developers? UX people? DevOps? The Less Usual Suspects? Product managers? Analysts? Customer success? Sales? Marketing? The CEO? The AI? Consider the scenarios below. All of them directly impact customers, making them think \"bad quality\". Consider who is responsible for the underlying problem (or more likely, problems)? Your app framework is extremely performant and glitch-free. Your app bombs. A feature does exactly what it promises, but people fail to use it right. Your company committed half of itself to ship a second product in record time, but customers never really wanted it. A huge update was pushed out on a do-or-die basis. Naturally it misbehaves, can't be rolled back, costs 5x as much to get right as it took to ship, and the rework effectively adds months to your plan of world domination. Your service fails to scale. You discover there were no benchmarks. A deployment breaks production. You discover a bad configuration. A feature leaks data to unintended users and breaks SLAs / regulations. Your CEO releases a statement blaming a DevOps engineer. A several-hour glitch goes un-monitored, causing serious widespread data corruption. Your production noticeably degrades often. A large sea mammal is your mascot. Your production seldom degrades, but when it does, it takes down half the known Internet along with it. and on and on… In a quiet moment of honest self-reflection, you may confess to the mirror that the thousand cuts metaphor applies. That any of the above scenarios were likely the product of corner-cuts, often near-invisible to the naked eye in the moment. Corner-cuts that added up—nay, compounded—over time; slowly as band-aids, then as stitches and casts, and then suddenly as gangrene. And maybe the whole thing died of those cuts, or continued as a barely alive entity until someone had the heart to pull the plug (or offer a bail out). You may even confess that maybe, just maybe, the job of assuring the goodness of a product belongs to every function involved in the product's life. Why? Suppose we model a traditional software production workflow, i.e. Analysis -> Product requirements -> UX/Design -> Development -> \"QA\" -> Production. Such a strictly linear model is common in the software industry at large. This is what it translates to in terms of time, complexity, costs, and risks.^ Feedback Analysis -> Product -> UX/Design -> Dev -> \"QA\" -> Prod --./--> arrives/ too late/-/-/- ^/--Price of fixing/--errors and/--- ^corner cuts./---|/---- ^| ~ AND/OR ~ /----|Compounding of /------ ^|software debt. /--------|| ---------- ^|| ~ AND/OR ~ ^||Increasing odds||| of being wrong. ---+--------------+------------+----------+-------+-----+----------------> Time, Complexity, Sunk costs Visualising a linear workflow this way suggests some things: All the risk is actually front-loaded at the Analysis stage. If that is wrong, then everything is wrong. The workflow looks linear, but has a compounding growth debt/risk profile. By tasking a single group with \"assuring\" product quality, we maximize our odds of being too wrong too late, as well as of entirely failing to spot bad news. What's not obvious from the picture is that the risk is rooted in feedback delays. Weak signals die when the deliver pressure is high. Our death-by-cuts risk profile will look the same, if the workflow is strictly linear as depicted above. It doesn't matter if we do it slowly in big batches over months, or faster as smaller batches over days. Small linearised batches may even worsen the aggregate risk profile, such as when market feedback loops are delayed or discontinuous. The smaller the batch, the more likely it is that feedback about several batches ago gets to us now. Such delayed feedback tends to severely disrupt strictly linear flows. The above picture is also incomplete. For the full story, we need to talk deeply about systems (a longer conversation, for another day). We can make a small start by doing scenarios. Consider points on a product spectrum, ways to destroy/create quality, and what might help us go from worse to better? Is it different for different kinds of products? Suppose we contrast two typical ends of the product spectrum defined by primary customer. Which one risks death by a thousand cuts? Trait Enterprise Product Consumer Product Key growth metric Revenue Growth User Growth Key sales driver Referrals + executive credibility Referrals + Friends-and-family experiences Customer risk High risk/reward per account Tiny unit economics per account Contract risk SLAs with crippling penalties 1 EULA / ToS that users don't read etc … … … Well, here's the thing. Not only does all software mutate, we also end up performing all kinds of deep surgery on the organisation that produces it. The whole thing—product and org—is simultaneously flexed, reconfigured, and even totally redesigned in-place with rapidity that is very uncommon in other industries. Why? Because software fundamentally is peoples' thoughts being played on repeat. So however we break it down, the common theme is this. Every hotfix is a cut. Every complaint is a cut. Every app crash is a cut. Every service outage is a cut. And so on. Each cut heals slowly and destroys Quality and value(ation). How to destroy Quality? It's useful to come up with ways to destroy quality, so that we may contrast those with ways to generate quality. I've seen and heard all of the following in work life so far (hopefully without actively perpetrating them, but memory is a fickle beast). Misconstrue and mislabel Software Testing as Quality Assurance. Testing is not \"Quality Assurance\". Ostensibly make all teams responsible for their \"QA\", which really means make the least experienced people do it day-to-day. Create a culture where it's normal to say things like this): \"Hey I'm adding this to the sprint. It's a small thing, so let's not slip our deadline.\" \"Testing is boring.\" \"We'll fix it if customers complain.\" \"Who the f*#$ wrote this code?\" \"Ah yes, those are known flaky tests. Just re-trigger the build.\" \"You don't know your job. Ship this.\" (This one stung. I'll tell you over beer/coffee :). Ensure designers, developers, and testers work on tasks and priorities set by others. Ensure someone catches the blame for mistakes. Set up incentives to make departments compete with each other. Hire a Vogon or a Darth Vader CEO. Further normalise all kinds of deviance. This was just a shortlist of things I recalled while writing this post. Think up as many ways as you can. #protip for inspiration: read CIA's now-declassified Simple Sabotage Field Manual. Pay special attention to part 11: General Interference with Organisations and Production. How to create Quality? One clue is to not do quality-destroying things. Another is to do the inverse of quality-destroying things (e.g. share know-how instead of hoarding it.) A third is to notice whether high-quality product producing organisations have any common traits (they do). Most important, perhaps, is to understand that there is no formula for how to acquire those traits. To design and build high quality software products, it is imperative to design and build high quality organisation-wide systems and culture. We have many tools, frameworks, fundamental ideas at our disposal. But no \"best practices\" process or methodology or \"one weird trick\" style intervention can fix broken systems and broken people. The \"way\" has to be co-evolved: by collaborative stakeholders, spread across the org, appropriate to the org's unique context, along with customers, partners, and the immediate ecosystem. This is universally a very difficult process, with challenges surprisingly similar to what it takes to recover fitness after a year of slacking off. It requires mindset, leadership, and persistent holistic intelligent eval/apply behaviour. And all of that derives from perspective. \"Perspective is worth 80 IQ points.\" — Alan Kay So, if we are to chart a course from Worse Quality to Better Quality, then it must be our first duty to purposely get really uncomfortable by seeking out new-to-us, diverse, status-quo-challenging perspective. And … The first skill is to learn to suffer constructively. We suffer, you and I. It is inevitable. Yet, it is also why life flourishes. \"Why are we suffering?\" is a great discussion to have, because constructive suffering yields quality outcomes. OK, back to the real world… The path to recovering a previous fitness peak after a year of slacking off is filled with sore muscles, cursing at the alarm clock, far too many days of being a generally irritable snappy person, and a constant mental battle against mainlining deliciously easy instant gratification. It gets harder before it gets easier. Then we reach the top of the previous S-curve. And we must begin the cycle again, to climb the next one. We are very fortunate. Fellow sufferers have been fostering quality-generative conversation and change all around us. We have access to a growing body of top-notch industry research and experience reports. Without exaggerating, very many of these lessons have been paid for in tears, blood, lives. Let's augment our intuitions with these power tools. Those hard-won 80 extra IQ points are ours for the taking. Some selected resources. Many inputs have shaped my thinking about Quality (well, all the things, because everything is connected); people, events, books, lectures etc. If you're wondering where to go. These are not prescriptions, but a sort of sampling platter. Triggers for your own searches. Please send me more! Systems: Thinking in Systems is a great primer.

Gene is gathering fantastic people and resources in one place. Definitely have a look-see. Caveats, mea culpa, etc. I am very much a work-in-progress, and this post is my current intuition. The post is heavily coloured by many witting and uwitting eval/apply loops comprised of personal failures, ignorant mistakes, and occasional wins, over the last about 20 years of professional life. And well, life life. It is also informed by the good fortune of having learned by working with people who understand the world far better than I do. And obviously a lot of reading, thinking, talking, frequently \"in anger\" after having hit walls and obstacles. So please take what is useful, and discard the rest.

    "commentBody": "How to think about software quality (2022) (evalapply.org)145 points by adityaathalye 23 hours agohidepastfavorite63 comments hiAndrewQuinn 17 hours agoMost software exists to save someone somewhere time. I think this is the One True Metric by which we measure Software Quality. Software which sells well historically has done so by saving huge numbers of people huge amounts of time, for whatever other complicated business they're already involved in. Excel, ERP systems, and GPT-4 all do this to great commercial success. You only need to step back and wonder how many more man hours it would take to do what they currently do by hand to realise this. Software can also save the time of other developers by being simple, well-architected, reliably documented, etc. This too is an aspect of software quality. Its recursive nature can often become a competitive advantage in its own right: High quality code, can lead to faster change implementations (fixes and features alike), which can filter downward to a higher quality product for the end user. reply yarekt 15 hours agoparentI like the sentiment, but you can have quality, well architected software that’s pleasure to work in, and it being completely useless/obsolete to customers. Value != quality. I think software quality (and all the symptoms discussed in the post) are to do with how quickly the software can be changed: Lower tech debt results in software that’s quick to change to new requirements, or change in business domain. It’s also important to realise that just like with performance, you get diminishing returns at very high levels reply detourdog 15 hours agorootparentI think software quality is more related fo how little it changes while remaining useful. I see the current software environment has different stake holders all defining quality from their own perspective. reply yarekt 13 hours agorootparentAh I see, quality can also mean ingenuity, but in my case as a software developer ingenious solutions don’t always present themselves. I’d settle for old boring plain solution that works well enough, but is of enough quality that it doesn’t cause fires, and is quick to change with the business reply hitchstory 9 hours agorootparentprevNot just how quickly it can be changed but how risky it is to change. reply TacticalCoder 8 hours agoparentprev> Most software exists to save someone somewhere time. Gaming. Social media. The Ads industry. These are all huge and they're not about saving anybody's time. reply teucris 16 hours agoprevMinor nit regarding this thing that will destroy quality: “We'll fix it if customers complain.\" You can’t fix everything, and perfect is the enemy of good. While punting testing to users is a no-no, recognizing that edge case issues can be deprioritized is crucial to getting things out the door. This means shipping stuff with known defects that you can respond to if necessary. reply adityaathalye 1 hour agoparentOP here. I agree and I think I imply habitual punting. No product or service can completely delight every customer. I would even say customers are forgiving of minor annoyances as long as they know the Big Important things are taken care of. Yet there is some point where the minor annoyances become too many. Finding ourselves at that point could be a \"too little too late\" situation, with a steep cost to recover lost trust. (edit: note I am OP) reply marcosdumay 15 hours agoparentprev> You can’t fix everything Oh, you certainly can't. But you can choose how many things needing fixing you will make. Doing some shit without thinking and waiting for people to complain about symptoms of deep issues is a very effective way to create lots and lots of need for fixing things. reply mdaniel 15 hours agorootparentAnd my experience has been that a quality culture like that can \"resource starve\" annoyances for literally years due to while True: ship_feature() if bugs: to_fix = highest_priority(bugs) fix = make_patch(to_fix) fix = introduce_new_bug(fix) # defer bugs[1:] until they meet the complaint criteria and that's how meetings end up with \"but, how hard can that possibly be to fix?\" statements reply hinkley 13 hours agorootparentI knew a guy who said on a previous project they had a system that raised the priority of old bugs on some interval. I guess the idea was to either get them fixed or agree that they never would. There are morale and duplicate bug issues with keeping a backlog that grows faster than you can close them, so I guess that makes a bit of sense. And better than GitHub auto-shooting-the-messenger by clocking bugs after a month or two of inactivity. reply NomDePlum 13 hours agorootparentprevIf you accept some bugs as \"features\" that you will accept, not fix, you can have a bug free policy. Doing this means you make decisions early and don't carry a ton of historical baggage that gets endlessly discussed. reply golergka 13 hours agoparentprev> You can’t fix everything But you can fix a lot. Some of the products I've worked at had Sentry alerts all the time that nobody paid attention to, whereas others (of very similar complexity) had them a few times a week, and every time somebody would immediately get on top of it and release a hotfix, usually in a span of the same day. reply pavel_lishin 20 hours agoprevSo much software suffers from a large class of users having no choice in its use. For example, our local school district uses Bloomz, which is pretty terrible - both on the web, and in its native app. I can report all the bugs I want, but since I'm never the person making a purchasing decision, how highly do I think those reports are prioritized? I wonder if the teacher/administrator side of things is better. reply dboreham 19 hours agoparentI found the best approach is to search LinkedIn for someone at the vendor that's closely connected to me, then compose a cheery message to that person introducing myself as a fellow developer and parent of a user, ask the best way to inject a bug report etc. This actually worked. Ymmv of course. reply computerfriend 18 hours agorootparentOne of the reasons I never put my employer on my LinkedIn profile. reply deprecative 15 hours agorootparentIf I got a message like this I'd just block the sender. As a developer I have no say in what my owner tells me to work on. I type what they want and nothing more. reply D-Coder 14 hours agorootparentThey're not asking you to fix anything. They are asking where to submit a bug report that someone (someone else) will look at. reply deprecative 8 hours agorootparentMy answer doesn't change. I'm not on LinkedIn during work hours. reply datavirtue 18 hours agorootparentprevMost of life's fulfilling opportunities come from just showing up. Showing up on searches, at work, at the pub. reply binarysneaker 18 hours agorootparentprevAs someone this happened to, I was actually impressed they looked me up and reached out. Knowing they cared that much meant that I cared too and I was able to prioritise the request with the product team. When we completed the request, we celebrated, and even implemented uservoice on some sites to improve the feedback loop. reply kqr 18 hours agorootparentprevOhh, this is actually clever. Subversive and I'm not sure I like it, but it sounds very effective. reply zx8080 18 hours agorootparentSounds like a hack to make a person to work overtime. reply the_fury 18 hours agorootparentIf I get a message on linkedin that pertains to a work issue, you had better believe that I'm going to be dealing with it on work time. reply amelius 18 hours agorootparentprev... while having fun while doing that work. reply germinalphrase 16 hours agoparentprevAs a former teacher, my experience of education specific software was almost universally negative. We may even get an in-person meeting with the software vendor only for the reported issues to remain unpatched indefinitely. reply dahart 15 hours agorootparentAs a developer, I’m not at all surprised, I suspect it’s negative from almost all points of view except at the district or city or state level where they pat themselves on the back for bringing technology into classrooms via spending some money, what little money they have, on tech that they don’t use and don’t understand. I don’t even have that much experience with it, but I’ve tried making educational software, in the form of multi-user whiteboards teachers could use for their classes. The people approving purchasing decisions don’t use the software, and don’t ask teachers or students about the experience or value of the software. The insane sales cycles are a never-ending nightmare of requirements and delays, far beyond the reasonable concerns about kids & privacy. After years of run-arounds, we gave up trying to use any official channels and just let teachers use the software free. As a parent, the experience was also very negative. My kids hated almost everything the school forced them to use, because the software was terrible compared to non-educational software. Teachers didn’t get any training on the software, and didn’t have the resources or time to use it effectively. Hardware was always outdated or supremely cheap and crappy. Possible the single worst software experience was the automated essay grading software. It was beyond broken, actively harmful, and it literally didn’t work. I came home from work one day and my oldest kid was in tears and my wife at her wits end trying to finish a homework assignment to write a short concise 2 paragraph essay on a specific topic and achieve an arbitrary 90% score or whatever within 10 tries, and they’d used up 8 of them and scores were going down each time. This software isn’t even supposed to be used unsupervised for grading, but the teachers didn’t seem to understand, and weren’t following recommendations. I figured out quickly the software doesn’t understand english and would score higher if you fed it more words, regardless of their quality or relevance - the polar opposite of the assignment’s goal. So I gave it a wikipedia article on why people shouldn’t use software grading robots, which scored 100%, and then scheduled a meeting with the teacher, who proceeded to complain about the software and told me she didn’t have a choice because it was district rules and a state software contract. reply ornornor 3 hours agorootparentThe cynic in me thinks this is 100% working as intended if you view school (especially before university) as an industrial sssembly line to produce the obedient little workers of the future. By making kids “accept” to be arbitrarily graded by an automated black box on seemingly virtuous but absurd criteria in practice, they’re being trained for what the future of work might become if coporations get their way and put AI everywhere they can. Or if they’re lucky they learn instead to cheat the system and/pr hack it but that’s a minority who will become misfits in their professional lives. I hope you were able to cheer your kid up, regardless but this is a scary look into the near future. reply adityaathalye 18 hours agoparentprevPost author here. I agree; so often constructive feedback loops from end users to builders are woefully absent from the equation. I feel the greater the distance between the purchase decision maker and the end user, the weaker the feedback gets. Riffing off the six degrees of separation idea and exponential drop off of signals though lossy media, it's like by the time someone gets to a third degree of separation, any feedback signal barely registers. Only mass action has any chance of being heard, much less heeded. reply AnimalMuppet 18 hours agorootparentAh. So that's (part of) why enterprise software is so universally bad. The users are further from the purchasers than they are in, say, developer tools. reply adityaathalye 17 hours agorootparentI believe so. I'll pick on Government websites and the systems that back them as an all-too-familiar, internationally reviled category of software, as an example. These tend to be incredibly painful to use. Some tendering process somewhere awards a contract to the lowest bidder who then has the unenviable job of wrangling the delightful intricacies of government machinery to put something out that maybe does what it was supposed to do for the common citizen. In such a world, I feel gov.uk stands out as a remarkable counter-example, worthy of emulation. e.g. https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles reply rqtwteye 15 hours agoparentprevThis plagues most enterprise software. Decisions are made by people who will most likely never actually use the software. So the decisions are made by cost and ease of dealing with the vendor. Usability is way down the list of priorities. reply jSully24 17 hours agoparentprevYou mention not being the person making a purchasing decision, who is? Can you connect with them? I would encourage you to put together a story that illustrates the pain being caused by this software and get with the purchasers. Not only might it help your organization figure out they need to do something different it could also show off your skills to the orgainization. Could you collect the time you and other people are spending working on these problems? How many issues are reported to you? How many bugs you've filed and have not had fixed by the vendor? Rolling this up into a real dollar coast it's having on you and the school district users. reply pavel_lishin 15 hours agorootparentThe person making the decision is very like the superintendent of the school system, likely informed by someone from IT and maybe someone representing the teachers somehow. They might listen to me if I bring in a coalition of other parents, but there's two reasons why I'm probably not going to do this: 1. They're likely locked into at least a year-long contract, if not more 2. Doing this is a huge amount of work for me. I'd have to find a significant number of parents who are _also_ as peeved as me, and then get them to take action - even if it's signing something - and then I'd have to bring the petition up to the school board, etc., etc., etc. It's much easier to just mute the notifications on the app, and go through them once a week. 99% of them are just wildly inactionable anyway - things like reminding me that school is out, or that a student interest group that's irrelevant to me is having a meeting two Thursdays from now. If I was annoyed enough to take action, I'd rather just offer to build them a replacement app - shorten that feedback loop, ya know? reply cratermoon 16 hours agorootparentprev> who is? Can you connect with them? For something like this, usually at the senior executive level, and organizationally. There's not really one person making the decision, it's done through the organization's decision-making system. Nominally there's a responsible person, but practically speaking that individual isn't completely autonomous. Large organizations have been making and dealing with decisions like this for ages, and rarely does dollar cost of usability ever influence. Products SAP and MS Teams get and retain market share by making the cost of moving off that software outweigh the gains. reply hitchstory 18 hours agoparentprevThis software also tends to be waterfalled to hell and back. Theyve already planned out their deliverables for the next 12 months and will be held accountable for meeting them. Your bugfix doesnt fit into that picture unless an exec treats it as a priority. ...in which case it'll be jammed into the devs' task queue with no expectation that the pre-agreed delivery dates will shift. reply datavirtue 18 hours agorootparentThe issues you describe have nothing to do with \"waterfall.\" reply hitchstory 17 hours agorootparent>Theyve already planned out their deliverables for the next 12 months and will be held accountable for meeting them. reply unclebucknasty 17 hours agorootparentNot sure I understand your point. Are you saying product roadmaps are incompatible with agile? reply hitchstory 15 hours agorootparentIf they include detailed plans and timelines for feature deliveries then yes. reply cratermoon 16 hours agoparentprevThere's a whole thing around the nature of who makes the purchasing decisions vs who are the real users. For key organizational systems like Bloomz for schools, the decision is made at the senior executive level, and input from the people who will use the software on a day-to-day basis is rarely, if ever, taken into consideration. Sometimes the decision is made on the golf course between business buddies. In these situations, the vendor doesn't have to care much about user experience or feedback, all they need to do is be able to check all the boxes on the whatever list of features management cares about. It comes up on HN off and on, here's an example: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21224209. Thread unrolled here: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1182635589604171776.html reply mojomark 16 hours agoprevGood read (reminder) and love the reference list. Question for the OP. I suspect we're of similar tenure, and I'd love to det your perspective... I'm a mechanical systems engineer in an industry that is growing from industrial automation to true autonomy (robotics). I've always liked coding, but don't do it enough to be a serious contributer to \"production quality\" code. Nevertheless, since last year I've transitioned from a more mechanical/hardware design firm to a much more mathy/software engineering firm. I find myself in a role, bridging robotics hardware and software teams working on a ~10yr old codebase. We have some great engineers! I've tended to stay on the customer requirements and algorithm development/analysis side of things, but I struggle with the lack of benchmarking and testing our group does, and I'm continuously surprised at the simple bugs we find that cause application crashes. Moreover, when a developer shows me code, I'm stricken by the number of undocumented \"magic numbers\" that seem like forgotten patches popped in there at one time to make things work for a test or demo, and the number if/then statements I see that are holding things together. I'm also faced with a growing cry for \"how can we best make use of these LLM things\" (for which there are a thousand and one answers). I see/feel the suffering, and what looks to me (from my 1000ft perch) like thousands of cuts. Bottom line, I'm increasingly thinking that I really need to take a month and try tracing through the thousands of lines of C++ (which I haven't really written since grad school) in order to truly understand the state/configuration of pur code baseline so that I can provide some more explicit leadership in terms of - do we refactor everything that looks messy or the we don't 100% understand? Do we take a T.O. to build up our automated unit and system level testing? etc. As a manager of a SW team, from your experience is it a good idea for me to dig deep into the code to gain an intimate understanding? That feels an awful lot like micromanagement to me, but I will do it if that's what 'wisdom of experience' in this domain proves is the most value-add. reply adityaathalye 1 hour agoparentOP here. Thank you for the kind remarks. Apologies because I can speak only in generalities; the devil is always in the details. As such this opinion, not prescription. I read your description as working through a conundrum of priorities, goals, and outcomes. Perhaps the way is to not get stuck in the weeds of either machines or computers. What outcome(s) matter for the overall system? What measures make sense in service of achieving those outcomes? How will people get feedback about progress in service of the outcomes? I am not suggesting some transplanted management framework (OKRs, I'm looking at you). Rather wondering about the small set of things you can get everyone to buy into and work towards. Decision making should become more tractable --- do the magic numbers even matter in the big picture? They may, if you desire to stay within a certain failure rate and/or error bounds, and it turns out the magic numbers are part of the problem. A thing like this won't be obvious in the beginning, you will to investigate things. Being able to say \"hey, our stuff is failing at X rate and it is hurting our product/business in A, B, C ways\" should help negotiate with management for the time / resource budget. Sometimes it may not be worth it, and so it may be wiser to drop that battle and focus on other outcomes. The investigation ought to be useful later. I noted Gene Kim's initiative [1] in my post (no affiliation). I feel like that collection of resources will give you much to work with. If you had to pick one of those, I would recommend the Accelerate [2] book. And, if you wish to talk about any of it, I'm happy to discuss more: https://www.evalapply.org/index.html#standing-invitation [1] https://itrevolution.com/the-idealcast-podcast/ [2] https://itrevolution.com/product/accelerate/ (edit: expand on the main part of the response) reply YZF 9 hours agoparentprevNot the OP but I'd say no. Fundamentally software quality issues are organization and people issues. This might sounds a little nasty but what do you think of organizations where the person managing software people is a mechanical engineer, with very little experience, who thinks he should go through all the code base to \"understand the state of the code\". I would say that's not the kind of organization that produces quality software. If you want to improve the software quality, invest in your software team. Work on the people- not on the code base. By your own description you're not the kind of person who should be leading the technical aspect, if you can't grow someone in the team to that role then hire someone to help with that. In terms of your other idea, more automated testing, the answer to that is almost always a yes. But again, get your team there. reply groos 16 hours agoparentprevIf you can't understand it yourself, you will have to find someone whose expertise you trust to answer the questions for you.

It could be my rose colored glasses, but it does seem like everyone truly feels a sense of ownership and pride in the product.

He assumes (correctly) that advice is not universally applicable and that each process needs to be traced back to fundamental axioms or requirements. As a random example I’m right now trying to explain this to a large government enterprise customer. They write “cold blooded” software, the type where they have a development project with a fixed budget and a fixed scope and then the code goes into hibernation for five years until they can “find the budget” again. So of course, they picked the Angular framework, one of the fastest moving, most “hot blooded” frameworks in the world. Angular might be the right choice for a startup writing highly interactive software. It is definitely the wrong choice for an org that thinks of maintenance as something that occurs twice a decade. It’s these things that most fundamentally kill quality. Picking a framework, language, or even operating system because it’s “hip” or “cool” or the “buzzword of the year”. Not because it’s suitable for the project.

Capitalism hates free software to the point that free software cannot even literally get a word, a voice, or a conceptualization that can help refine it.

    "originBody": "Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Travel Earth Video Live The cities stripping out concrete for earth and plants By Chris Baraniuk Features correspondent City of Leuven Lifting up the paving slabs reveals the potential of the earth beneath (Credit: City of Leuven) From Australia to Ontario, cities are taking up unnecessary stretches of concrete and asphalt, allowing nature to take hold in their place. On a hot July day, Katherine Rose picked up a sturdy metal pole and jammed it under the tempting lip of a pre-cut concrete slab. Rose, communications and engagement director at Depave, a non-profit in Portland, Oregon, was sweating in the heat – but she was going to win this fight. The grubby, rectangular section of urban crust in front of her was about to move. Pushing down on her metal bar, applying it like a lever, she eased the concrete covering up and away. Now sunlight could fall once again on the ground below. A mess of gravel and dirt that was, to Rose, just bursting with potential. \"It feels like you're liberating soil,\" she says, recalling the summer gathering where she and around 50 volunteers removed roughly 1,670 sq m (18,000 sq ft) of concrete from the grounds of a local church. \"It's envisioning and fully realising a dream that I think we all have,\" says Rose. The dream, that is, of bringing nature back into our midst. The idea of depaving, sometimes known as desealing, is a simple one – replace as much concrete, asphalt and other forms of hard landscaping as possible with plants and soil. It's been around since at least 2008, when the Depave group in Portland was founded. Proponents say depaving allows water to soak into the ground, which reduces flooding in times of heavy rain – aiding the \"sponginess\" of cities. Native plants help wildlife cling on in urban spaces, and by planting trees you can increase shade, protecting residents from heatwaves. Injecting city streets with greenery may even improve people's mental health, too. But if depaving is ever going to really take off, it will have to expand beyond a handful of eager environmentalists and volunteers. With the climate crisis deepening, some cities and even entire regions are beginning to adopt depaving as part of their climate adaptation strategies. It's time, some say, to start smashing up our concrete streets in a big way – to create spaces better for nature. City of Leuven Exposing more of the ground in urban spaces can help absorb rainfall and reduce flooding, as well as boost biodiversity (Credit: City of Leuven) Whenever Rose walks through a city these days, she can't help but notice places where you could strike out a section of asphalt and put in some plants. \"I'm constantly just wanting to do more,\" she confesses. \"It's hard not to see it everywhere.\" Sign up to Future Earth Sign up to the Future Earth newsletter to get essential climate news and hopeful developments in your inbox every Tuesday from Carl Nasman. This email is currently available to non-UK readers. In the UK? Sign up for newsletters here. Her group says it has depaved more than 33,000 sq m (360,000 sq ft) of asphalt in Portland alone since 2008 – an area equivalent to nearly four and a half football pitches. The work is \"joyous\", says Rose, because it unites enthusiastic local volunteers. They get a safety briefing and then muck in together. Green Venture, an environmental non-profit in Ontario, Canada, has been inspired in part by the depaving projects in Portland. Giuliana Casimirri, executive director, explains how she, her colleagues, and volunteers have begun inserting miniature gardens replete with native trees in a run-down district in the town of Hamilton. \"Before, it was somewhere you would quickly try to walk through,\" she says. \"Now there are places you might stop or have a chat. Sit and read the paper.\" In Hamilton, flooding can cause sewage to get mixed into runoff that flows into Lake Ontario, the source of the town's drinking water. Green Venture and other local organisations are keen to reduce the chances of that happening, says Casimirri. They view depaving as a key tactic. Certainly, studies have demonstrated that impermeable surfaces in gardens such as concrete increase flood risk in urban areas. Rose says her group's efforts in Portland mean that approximately 24.5 million gallons of rainwater is diverted from entering storm drains each year. In Leuven, Belgium, in 2023 alone, Baptist Vlaeminck, who leads Leuven's Life Pact climate adaptation project, calculates that the removal of 6,800 sq metres (73,000 sq ft) of hard surfacing allowed for the infiltration of an additional 377,000 gallons (1.7 million litres) of water into the ground. \"With climate change, extreme weather rainfall events are going to increase and so [depaving is] not a nice-to-have – it's a necessity,\" Casimirri adds. The question is whether the authorities responsible for cities, and planning, realise this. In most parts of the world, depaving can still be described as a fringe activity. \"We're going to need a scale of investment that has a lot more zeroes on it,\" says Thami Croeser at RMIT University, Melbourne's Centre for Urban Research. Community-led and DIY efforts on driveways and on local streets with permission are fantastic, he adds, but it's even better to think of depaving and greening as the introduction of a new kind of infrastructure in a city. It requires the same level of planning and investment as, say, a new railway. Elle Hygge The depave movement in Portland, Oregon has inspired a wave of cities to pull up their asphalt and concrete (Credit: Elle Hygge) In Europe, at least, some municipalities have begun to treat depaving seriously. Residents of London in the UK are encouraged to depave their gardens, for example. The city of Leuven in Belgium says it is embracing depaving – or \"ontharden\" – in a big way. The suburban district of Spaanse Kroon, home to around 550 people, is one of the latest targets of a depaving and renaturing initiative spearheaded by the city. The plans involve removing significant volumes of asphalt from the residential area and forcing cars to share the same part of the road as pedestrians and cyclists. \"We are scaling up now, we are setting up a team dedicated to depaving,\" says Vlaeminck. Such projects have to meet the needs of everyone in the city. Vlaeminck says that, to support people with impaired vision or mobility issues, unused areas of road or pavement are prioritised for depaving and sufficient space – more than a metre – is safeguarded on pavements to allow people plenty of room. Existing paving left in place is also renewed or repaired to ensure there are no bumps or unevenness. In situations where pavements are removed completely, for shared use of a roadway in low traffic neighbourhoods, Vlaeminck says depaving teams introduce measures to reduce the speed of cars. Both Depave in Portland and Green Ventury in Ontario say they work with communities to ensure accessibility requirements are met. Casimirri refers to a recent project that replaced broken, uneven concrete with shrubbery and level walkways between. Among the initiatives instigated by Leuven is a \"tile taxi\" – a small truck that officials will happily send to your home so you can throw in concrete tiles or cobblestones you have removed from your garden. The material is later reused rather than thrown away, says Vlaeminck, who adds that several million euros have been set aside by Leuven to fund depaving and renaturing projects such as this. And there's more. Since January 2024, developers in Leuven have had to demonstrate that any rain that falls on new or significantly renovated homes can either be capture and re-used on-site or filtrate into the property's garden rather than pool up and cause a flood. If developers can't prove their designs are extreme rainfall-ready, they won't be approved, says Vlaeminck. France, too, is making depaving official, says Gwendoline Grandin, an ecologist with the Île-de-France Regional Agency for Biodiversity. Nationally, the French government has made €500m ($540m/£430m) available for urban greening – this includes depaving but also installing green walls and roofs, for example. Part of the motivation is to make towns and cities more resilient to summer heatwaves, which have badly affected parts of France in recent years. Some of the projects now underway are significant in size, such as a former parking area near a forest in the Paris region. An area of 45,000 sq m (480,000 sq ft) has been depaved – formerly a hodgepodge of asphalt, pathways and concrete interlaced with grass. With the hard landscaping now gone, level ground is being reshaped to introduce dips and gullies that catch water, and the whole area will soon be planted over, too. City of Leuven Local schemes are often backed by residents keen to see more green in their local area (Credit: City of Leuven) In Croeser's own city of Melbourne, he and colleagues have studied the potential space available for renaturing, if thousands of parking spaces were depaved and converted into miniature gardens. In a 2022 study, they simulated the impact based on a series of scenarios – the most ambitious of which involved removing half of the open-air parking spaces in the city, about 11,000. Croeser argues that there is sufficient off-street parking available, for example on the ground floor of buildings, in Melbourne to ensure that people wouldn't be left without somewhere to leave their vehicle – but those interior parking spaces would need to be made publicly accessible. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 140kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. \"The basic principle was no net loss of access to parking,\" he says. \"And we get 50-60 hectares [120-150 acres] of green space that keeps the city cool, prevents flooding.\" It might seem unlikely that small pockets of nature dotted here and there throughout a large city like Melbourne could benefit wildlife significantly, but Croeser says these fragments of habitat are crucial. They allow species to move around and cope in an environment that is, ultimately, very different to the one in which they evolved. In their 2022 study on depaving in Melbourne, Croeser and his colleagues included modelling that suggested a modest increase in greenery could allow species such as the blue-banded bee to roam across a far greater area of urban habitat than before. Rose agrees with Croeser that, for depaving to change the world, entire cities and even whole countries will have to embrace it fully. But she emphasises that, in order to reach that point, communities must express that this is something they want. \"It starts with people pushing their government and starting these conversations on a small, local level,\" she says. \"That's how it takes hold.\" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

The former is the central business district and surrounding area, the one with 33,000 open air car parks of which the local academic they interviewed appears to be proposing 11,000 be replaced by greenery. It is a nice thought, but the City of Melbourne (think Westminster or City of London in a London context) is notoriously reliant on revenue from those car parks and isn’t about kill that goose yet. Their policy [0] is to “support the conversion of car parking spaces to be used for another function where there is a strategic need to do so” - and the list of functions doesn’t include greenery for its own sake. In fairness, there are already a lot of parks within the municipality. The latter is the metro area of 5 million people 100km across, and most of it has plenty of green space. For example, most residential streets have a wide grassed verge with street trees. There is definitely a problem with gardens disappearing under apartments and McMansions, but it’s mostly not car parking that’s driving habitat loss.

I can see the highways, and I can see the subways, and I can see the patios, and so forth: suddenly the highway department comes along, and says, “There’s a rose growing in the middle of Highway 101!” And then—then—the robot power group will have to send a group of the highway department to kill the rose and put the asphalt down on the gentle, naked skin of the soil.

But speaking for the UK it wont work. You add more green space, you add more maintenance, and with most of the countries councils being incapable of mowing the lawns even before most of them were bordering on bankrupcy it does beg the question - who's paying for it.

Stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces joins the sewer system; under normal conditions, this means we have to pay to clean it, and under high flow conditions, it means the sewers go into the overflow system, dumping feces into the river. This isn't a universal problem, but it means there's a pretty big benefit to reducing runoff, and the city has been pursuing it aggressively for the last 20 years or so, to good effect. (The runoff also leads to localized road flooding, which is again both dangerous to road traffic and expensive to mitigate.) reply mathieuh 3 hours agorootparentIn England the water companies routinely dump raw sewage into waterways, to the point where it isn’t safe to swim or even go near the water in many places and there are massively deleterious effects on ecosystems. It’s a huge scandal at the moment because the formerly public and now privatised water companies are doing this dumping while continuing to pay huge dividends to shareholders and the toothless regulator is doing nothing about it. reply bobthepanda 7 hours agoparentprevusually these kinds of initiatives also involve planting local plants, and specifically not manicured lawns for this purpose. Lawn grass isn't even native to North America, and a lot of the examples are North American. This is usually meant to retain enough water to prevent building lots of grey infrastructure. The Thames Tideway tunnel to lower the amount of sewage outflow in London is 4.3B pounds. In that context, building a lot of mini-retention ponds for tens of thousands of pounds is a lot cheaper. and this isn't the only strategy; a lot of modern parks, for example, are built with facilities like courts for sports below the ground level of the park, so that during flood times they turn into bathtub holding ponds as well. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Tideway_Tunnel reply multjoy 1 hour agoparentprevNot mowing is better for the environment and the budget. reply baq 38 minutes agorootparentNot all roses though: high grass makes for a lot of ticks. reply kjkjadksj 8 hours agoparentprevThey’ve figured it out in parts of the UK at least.

The most recent Fire TV software update has blocked a Fire TV capability that has been present since the original model’s release in 2014. This is a basic Android capability that, to my knowledge, no other Android-based device manufacturer has ever had issues with, let alone blocked. This change has rendered popular Fire TV apps, which have been in Amazon’s own Appstore for years, useless. Worse yet, Amazon seems to have been careless in implementing this change without even a courtesy email to the affected app developers, all under the, seemingly false, guise of enhanced security. Code excerpt of Amazon’s change to Fire TV’s ADB connection that denies local connections. Sent to me by an affected app developer. Amazon has blocked the ability for Fire TV apps to establish local ADB connections and, in turn, execute ADB commands. While it’s not a capability used by many Fire TV apps, without it, Fire TV apps can no longer perform certain advanced tasks, such as freeing up internal storage space by clearing the cache of all installed apps. This change has been verified to be present in Fire TV update 7.6.6.9 for Fire OS 7 devices, like the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Cube, and update 8.1.0.3 for Fire OS 8 devices, like the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Stick 4K Max. It is unknown if older Fire TV models running Fire OS 6 or Fire OS 5 will also be receiving this change, but it seems likely. This update does not change the ability of external devices, like computers or phones, to establish an ADB connection with a Fire TV, which remains possible. When I asked Amazon if this change was intentional and performing as intended because multiple readers and developers were asking me about it, Amazon’s only reply to me was “We are aware of reports that some apps have been impacted by a recent security update.” Since then, the developer of the immensely popular app Remote ADB Shell, which has over half a million downloads and has been heavily crippled by Amazon’s update, has reached out to me with evidence that the change by Amazon is certainly deliberate. While Amazon is stating this change is in the name of improved security, I don’t buy it. While ADB commands can be very powerful and, therefore, should only be allowed to run with care, all Android-based devices, including Fire TVs, have several precautions in place to keep users safe from apps or devices trying to execute nefarious ADB commands. ADB connection request on Fire TVs Before any ADB command can be executed on a Fire TV, an ADB connection to the device must be made. This starts by selecting the Fire TV’s model name in its “About” menu seven times to reveal a hidden developer menu. Then, an “ADB debugging” option must be enabled from said hidden menu. Finally, every unique ADB connection request from a device or app, be it a local or external connection, results in a full-screen prompt that must be allowed before the ADB connection is made. These numerous ADB-related security hoops are in place on all Fire TV models and are common to all Android-based devices. No manufacturer apart from Amazon has felt the need to enhance device security by blocking local ADB connections, despite most non-Amazon Android devices being phones, which hold far more private and critical user data than a Fire TV streaming media player. Most likely, this change is an idiotic way for Amazon to protect its Fire TV home screen from being bypassed and, in turn, to protect its profits. Apps commonly used by the Fire TV modding community will often use local ADB connections to detect remote button presses. That detection allows the use of alternate home screens, which aren’t inundated with things like auto-playing fullscreen video ads like Amazon’s own home screen. While it’s an unpopular opinion, I see nothing wrong with Amazon protecting its Fire TV revenue by stopping the use of alternative home screens. It’s crucial to the business model Amazon has chosen to use for the Fire TV and if customers don’t like it, they don’t have to buy one. However, blocking a core OS capability and breaking popular apps in a futile effort to protect the Fire TV home screen is shortsighted and foolish. It’s the equivalent of a town mayor demolishing a bridge used by everyone because their political opponent lives on the other side. What makes this Fire TV change even worse is how Amazon has treated the developers affected by it. Two popular Fire TV apps affected by this change are TDUK APP Killer and TDUK APP Cache Cleaner, which use local ADB commands to force quit and clear the cache of all apps with a single button press. I’ve been going back and forth with the app’s developer, popular Fire TV YouTuber TechDoctorUK, all week trying to get to the bottom of why his apps were suddenly and unexplainably marked as incompatible with all Fire TV models, despite not receiving any notice from Amazon and his apps appearing “Live” with “No issues found” in his Amazon developer portal. Emails shown to me from Amazon stated that TechDoctorUK’s apps were removed for failing tests that resulted in error messages being displayed by the apps. However, the Amazon testing that resulted in those errors was done on non-Amazon devices (i.e., Android phones), despite the apps only being listed by TechDoctorUK as compatible with Fire TV devices. After being given the runaround for a couple of days, only after I reached out to Amazon about this issue did TechDoctorUK receive an email that stated: “Because your app overrides the native user experience (e.g., with a lockscreen, or widget), it has not been published on Amazon devices.” Given that force-stopping apps and clearing app cache are both native capabilities of Fire TVs, just not with a single click, I interpret the email as Amazon’s canned way of saying we don’t want your app on Amazon devices. During my brief stint as a Fire TV Product Manager at Amazon, I was put on a team tasked with changing a Fire TV capability that could affect existing apps. We created and executed a plan that involved contacting affected app developers ahead of the change, helping them update their app if needed, and addressing customer issues that might arise, among other things. What we certainly didn’t do is carelessly push out the change, ghost ban affected apps, give developers the runaround, and reply to concerns with irrelevant canned replies. Blocking local ADB connections on Fire TVs is a shortsighted decision. If the goal was to further protect the Fire TV home screen, it should have been achieved in any number of other ways that didn’t require breaking legitimate apps.

Sammy says: February 23, 2024 at 9:16 pm You should create your own streaming tv box so we can buy it and kick Amazon fire tv to the curb Reply Dave says: February 24, 2024 at 6:33 am Agreed, or someone with experience should… Please Reply Scott46953 says: February 24, 2024 at 8:42 pm Nvidia makes the best streaming box called Nvidia Shield and also has two versions! Amazon streaming devices was just for low budget or beginners. Elias Saba (AFTVnews) says: February 24, 2024 at 11:03 am I wish it was that simple. While there are plenty of generic hardware choices to use out of China, getting proper software and app support is a monumental task. It’s not as simple as installing generic Android and tapping into the Play Store. There’s hope that Sonos comes out with something decent that isn’t too locked down, but I’m sure it’s not going to compete with Amazon on price and cost quite a bit.

Is this a sign of the problem Reply Geoff says: February 23, 2024 at 10:29 pm This is an ill omen of what amazon will do with there own OS. Options I can think of are:- 1. Don’t buy amazon devices if they stop you doing what you want to do 2. Hopefully some developer/s may start developing custom ROMs that can replace the amazon OS Reply Richard Guilcher says: February 24, 2024 at 2:30 am I am already eyeing up my amazon devices and considering getting rid of all of them.

I have many android boxes and fire devices. I was surprised when I hooked up the ONN, I really liked it. Reply lightningstreams says: February 24, 2024 at 3:26 pm the only thing I don’t like about the ONN is the fact there’s no backstop from people loading so many apps it gets maxed out and breaks the Bluetooth / wifi radio, killing the communication with the remote. Reply Roger says: February 24, 2024 at 4:12 pm I was keeping this a secret, but what I did before any Amazon updates was a factory reset, then using a flash drive installed Firewall AI, allowing current apps to access the internet with the option to block newly installed apps. Then opened the Firewall AI app and blocked the Updater apps from Amazon, and also the unwanted apps like Kids Amazon, Music, etc., and until this day still hasn’t installed any updates from Amazon. It is also needed to install the Orientation app to make Firewall AI accessible, good luck if you are able to revert back to original Fire Stick OS. Reply Frank says: February 23, 2024 at 3:11 pm I have all 8 of my firetv devices updates blocked, 0S 5,6,7. Reply Kenny says: February 23, 2024 at 5:14 pm It’s not going to help your going to wake up to your device restarting then updating. It’ll be a forced update , then your device will restart and you’ll be on Amazon’s new OS VEGA… Reply Greg says: February 23, 2024 at 5:18 pm That’s. Not Correct at this time. This has Nothing to Do with the OS Been Changed to Linux. This Only Affecting ADB debugging. Different Subject all together Reply Alan says: February 23, 2024 at 3:18 pm It looks like it’s the start of amazon restricting what you can do. I wouldn’t be surprised if they stop allowing side loading as well in the future. I used the TDUK apps on my devices and they are really good apps. I myself have dumped all fire sticks and am using another android tv device going forward. On my Nvidia Shield Tv, the TDUK apps work.

Reply greedyiphones says: February 23, 2024 at 3:37 pm So much for their customer-centric business model. I think the writing was on the wall when they stopped production of the Recast. Is all this worth 2-day free shipping? I’m beginning to wonder… Reply NPmatt says: February 24, 2024 at 2:01 pm That’s already gone away for most of us in areas where Amazon doesn’t have its own delivery fleet. For two Christmases now I’ve had in-stock gift items ordered before Thanksgiving delivered after Christmas. Two years ago maybe they could blame COVID. This year they can’t. Other than Amazon Marketplace orders (others selling on Amazon), I haven’t received an Amazon order in under two weeks in over a year, and most take 3-4 weeks. They don’t even ship for a week or more. I ordered in-stock TurboTax for S-Corps before Christmas and cancelled the order when it still hadn’t shipped by the time my 1099s had to be filed (Jan 31). Sometimes they’ll sit on an in-stock order for weeks then ship it 2-day air when timely ground shipping would have been cheaper and faster. Stupid. Last year they charged me for “free” gift cards advertised as premiums for buying TurboTax–with no return options. And you can’t critique Amazon Fullfillment on their site–only Marketplace Sellers. Sorry I’m long-winded and wandered off-subject, but there’s vitually nowhere to critique the crap they’re doing and I’m pissed. Reply Donna says: February 24, 2024 at 5:45 pm Always check to see what Amazon Prime is charging this year. I have prime, it is 139.00 a year, I was charged 150.00. I called and they said that it would be adding tax to Amazon Prime. They did take the tax off , but from here on out we will be paying 150.00 a year. I will probably drop Amazon Prime. Try to find something cheaper and better. Reply Earl Jackson says: February 23, 2024 at 3:38 pm Amazon is systematically destroying the future for their devices by making drastic changes and affecting the way end users enjoy streaming. In one single shot they will destroy what they worked so hard to establish. Shame on them! Reply T Mendez says: February 24, 2024 at 9:52 am Yes. It’s what made them popular. But they will learn in the long run. Reply RG Geiger says: February 23, 2024 at 3:46 pm on my yearly Vaca I fired up my old Chromecast and was surprised to see the live TV guide was considerably better and the continue wAtching carousel on the home screen was working with nearly every service I’m using and not just the ones I subscribed to on the UI (like firetv). I may be switching when I get back Reply Topdog says: February 24, 2024 at 8:41 am Equivalent to blowing up a bridge because of a political rival?!? Maybe the actual equivalent is more like blocking a freeway entrance to force everyone to use the toll road…maybe.

I wish Amazon would try to pull that BS, and I will be on the phone w/ customer support so fast to get a refund for all the Fire TV devices running in my house since that’s called false advertising, by removing functionality that was originally included when I initially bought those devices. Reply Kjl562022 says: February 23, 2024 at 4:24 pm Fire tv stick 4k max, 7.6.6.9 , developer options gone, pressed the action button 7x, developer option back, for now Reply msinim625 says: February 24, 2024 at 10:06 am yes that’s what I had to do in order to install my app. And as mentioned, back for now. who knows if they will remove that in the near future Reply Elias Saba (AFTVnews) says: February 24, 2024 at 11:18 am I’ll reiterate that nothing has changed regarding developer options, external ADB connections, and unknown sources. It’s only internal ADB connections made by apps already installed on your Fire TV that have been blocked. This block does not make it harder to sideload. It just removes a tool that apps have been able to use for advanced tasks for years. Reply Lynne says: February 23, 2024 at 4:27 pm It seems amazon just isn’t making enough money already so they have to screw all the people that bought their over-priced crapola anyway ,myself included,but if this is the wave of the future,Screw Amazon Reply O.R. Mitchell says: February 23, 2024 at 7:31 pm Just wanting some clarification: It was not obvious from the code snippet provided, whether the issue was a FireTV App making a connection to the ADB server at the “localhost” e.g. “127.0.0.1” address -or- if it was also blocking the resident FireTV App from making a connection to ADB servee using the FireTV system’s network IP address -or- if the incoming ADB connection request has the IP address of the FireTV device -or- All of the above? Does anyone know the answer? Or asked a different way does the ADB server test for or nolonger listens on “127.0.0.1” (a.k.a “localhost”)? Or does the ADB server look at the source IP address of the client and refuses connections if that source IP matches the IP address of the FireTV device? The reason for asking is that if the prohibition is for incoming connections to “127.0.0.1” then changing the connection attempt to the network address of the FireTV device will circumvent the restriction… If it’s both, then there is no way for an App on the FireTV device to connect locally to the ADB server! By the way, for the more geeky types, there is a ‘simple’ way to “fix” this but it would require a second system running a simple proxy software that would accept connections from the FireTV device and then turnaround and make another connection to the ADB server of the FireTV device and those local App’s connections would look like any other external device making an ADB connection! For example, the Unix/Linux standard utility called “netcat” or “nc” could be easily used in this masquerading or proxying scheme… A RaspberryPi on the local network could easily be used to perform this function! Thanks, in advance, for any clarification! Reply Elias Saba (AFTVnews) says: February 24, 2024 at 11:42 am It appears as though they are taking the connection address and trying to bind to it to determine if it’s local, since you can’t bind to an external address. So, if binding is successful or results in the error EADDRINUSE, then they consider it a local connection.

Reply Paul Grant says: February 23, 2024 at 5:49 pm If Amazon makes it so one can’t sideload the Firesticks that would be the end of most sales of firesticks! Most people will resort to buying android boxes instead. Stocks for Amazon thhenm will drop in lightning speed in a matter of weeks. After all that’s why we purchase Firesticks. I have bought well over at least 1000 4K sticks over a preriod of 5 years! Reply Anonymous says: February 24, 2024 at 12:09 pm I doubt that 200 million people eagerly bought FIRE TV devices to immediately sideload apps on them. That is such a small minority of use cases that are always amplified on sites like this where power users exist. I get that you may personally choose to stop using them. I doubt that it will be the downfall of FIRE TV devices. Reply Rob says: February 25, 2024 at 1:43 am I think you would be surprised at how many people are buying modded firesticks to watch TV on “unofficial” apps, people that have no idea of how it works but know how to pay someone that does to make it work. Reply Alexander Grace says: February 23, 2024 at 6:18 pm My Fire TV cube is powered down and sitting on the shelf while my $15 ONN streaming device is performing beautifully. Does anyone know of a ROM to make the cube do something useful? Has anyone else noticed their Alexa devices asking you to repeat yourself and not performing requested tasks lately? I think Amazon may be finished with the device business since they are not driving sales. Reply Kathy says: February 24, 2024 at 1:28 am I love my Onn box. Best decision I ever made Reply Carl says: February 23, 2024 at 6:39 pm I can’t even use my prime video app on my fire stick. The movies won’t play. Nothing will play on there Reply Keith says: February 23, 2024 at 7:00 pm This is what I really needed to move on. With that absurdly busy home screen that’s now an eye AND ear sore and the fact that i needed to delete apps tonight just to squeeze in a Netflix update…who would want one these devices? I don’t have Kodi installed anymore. I don’t have an abundance of apps. So Im thinking your basic, click and watch non-techie is also frustrated as hell. 8 GB of storage in 2024 is insulting to the consumer. My hope is that Amazon will want to have Prime exclusively on fire tv. I won’t have access to it and therefore won’t need to watch ads on a paid streaming service. Reply Bee Altieri says: February 23, 2024 at 7:19 pm Yes Keith , non techie here and all I know is I hate my fire TV! Constant problems and everyone else I know are saying the same thing. I turn it off and go to my other TV with Roku and ZERO problems. It’s now a fact all our fire tvs are on their way out of our lives.They basically are putting their own selves out of business.

Mitchell says: February 23, 2024 at 7:29 pm Just wanting some clarification: It was not obvious from the code snippet provided, whether the issue was a FireTV App making a connection to the ADB server at the “localhost” e.g. “127.0.0.1” address -or- if it was also blocking the resident FireTV App from making a connection to ADB servee using the FireTV system’s network IP address -or- if the incoming ADB connection request has the IP address of the FireTV device -or- All of the above? Does anyone know the answer? Or asked a different way does the ADB server test for or nolonger listens on “127.0.0.1” (a.k.a “localhost”)? Or does the ADB server look at the source IP address of the client and refuses connections if that source IP matches the IP address of the FireTV device? The reason for asking is that if the prohibition is for incoming connections to “127.0.0.1” then changing the connection attempt to the network address of the FireTV device will circumvent the restriction… If it’s both, then there is no way for an App on the FireTV device to connect locally to the ADB server! By the way, for the more geeky types, there is a ‘simple’ way to “fix” this but it would require a second system running a simple proxy software that would accept connections from the FireTV device and then turnaround and make another connection to the ADB server of the FireTV device and those local App’s connections would look like any other external device making an ADB connection! For example, the Unix/Linux standard utility called “netcat” or “nc” could be easily used in this masquerading or proxying scheme… A RaspberryPi on the local network could easily be used to perform this function! Thanks!

Reply Daniel says: February 24, 2024 at 10:51 am What do you mean, “if you don’t like it, you don’t have to buy a fire stick” referencing the full screen auto play ads?!

Reply Elias Saba (AFTVnews) says: February 24, 2024 at 11:58 am That was in reference to not being able to change the home screen, not the ads. I definitely agree the auto-playing ads cross the line and feel like a bait-and-switch. As for not being able to change the home screen, that isn’t a bait-and-switch because Amazon has been adamant from the very beginning that alternate launchers aren’t allowed. Fire TV buyers shouldn’t be buying with the expectation that they can change the home screen. If they do, that’s their mistake in lack of research before buying. Conversely, every Fire TV owner who bought before the auto-playing ads were added did so with the expectation that the device wouldn’t blast them with ads every time it powered on. That’s not their mistake and they should all be entitled to full refunds if they want it. Reply BigRed says: February 24, 2024 at 10:53 am Non techie here. Reading all these comments.. I have an android tv in one room and fire sticks in three, I hardly use the fire sticks and while I love my android tv, google isn’t much better about clearing the cache. If I do not clear, the entire TV slows down. EVERYTHING. So since before I read this article and the comments, I didn’t know I could download one app to take care of clearing the caches, I CAN DEFINITELY SEE WHILE EVERYONE IS ANNOYED. ESPECIALLY APP DEVELOPERS. it’s a freaking hassle . Furthermore, why must huge tech companies rule the earth? Isn’t there enough to go around for everyone?

But then I just won’t be able to download any new updates or versions? Reply Elias Saba (AFTVnews) says: February 24, 2024 at 12:00 pm You’re fine. The changes to ADB that have been made will not affect your ability to install or update Kodi. The changes have nothing to do with sideloading “unknown apps.” Reply Phil says: February 24, 2024 at 12:24 pm Likely not “an idiotic way” but rather an urgent security update to patch a new exploit which if able to be exploited and issue adb commands could be classed as very severe. I suspect Amazon rightly cared more about end users security than breaking some apps until they can come up with a better solution and patch. Reply Elias Saba (AFTVnews) says: February 24, 2024 at 1:14 pm Respectfully, I disagree. Local ADB connections are not a “new exploit” and are in no way an “urgent security” threat. They have existed for as long as Android has and have a robust set of barriers that every manufacturer, apart from Amazon now, feels is sufficient to keep users safe. I say this change is idiotic because apps have used local ADB connections to bypass the home screen since at least 2016 and Amazon has sucessfully stopped all of them without needing to block local ADB connections and without hurting Fire TV functionality or crippling usefull apps. The decision to block local ADB now, when Amazon has proven there are pleanty of other options in the past, is lazy and narrow minded. Whoever made this call shouldn’t be making Fire TV decisions.

Reply Andr'e Wood says: February 24, 2024 at 2:38 pm One of the 1st ways I used to stream was through Kodi, although I haven’t for many years but it’s still out there. Others are Android TV (various devices), Roku (various devices), chromecast (for me this one’s a bit hit and miss) Google TV, and as much as I don’t like it, there’s also Apple TV. Everyone will tell you what they use is the best, I think all of them (except if you’re a newbie to Kodi) are quick and easy to set up but each one has it’s own Pro’s & Cons so read up on them first to see which suits you. Looking forward, anyone of these will be % more use to you than Amazon devices in the near future with the company heading down that slippery spiral staircase – even Kodi.

It’s difficult but that’s the workless cash machine. I’m most upset about my DualShock 4. My buttons were remapped from the OS level so now the buttons don’t call functions properly. People use this service all the time! Keeping things the way they were versus some apps that might take advantage of larger super user functions might be the aim though…If it’s not your input, it is someone else’s..But what does that have to do with my controller!?

    "commentBody": "Amazon blocks long-running FireTV capability, Breaking apps with no warning (aftvnews.com)136 points by thunderbong 8 hours agohidepastfavorite75 comments pushedx 4 hours agoIn the Android security model, this is not a capability that should have ever been provided to apps to begin with. It allows for apps to have almost free reign over the filesystem of other apps (read, write, modify), among other powerful capabilities. No flagship Android phones on the market allow this. It would be like if the Facebook app on your iOS device could read all of the files of your banking app, or notes app. It's just not something that is enabled in any Android system claiming to have some level of security. reply oefrha 1 hour agoparentYeah, it’s amusing that the author simultaneously claims that (a) it’s a “core OS capability”; (b) it’s a developer debugging capability gated behind so many hoops that it can’t be abused (which is of course nonsense because even though each connection needs to be approved, the app allegedly only clearing other apps’ cache could be doing any number of evil things after the approval). These are incompatible claims. You can fundamentally disagree with the Android security and isolation model, but if you were okay with it before this update, then the arguments presented are just an incoherent mess. reply hmeh 6 hours agoprevI appreciate people taking the time to write articles like this, but please consider the people who are going to read it.

If you've used ADB a half hundred times, weren't you ever curious what it stood for? I can't even use acronyms without knowing what they mean - it's always the first thing I look up, primarily because it helps me really remember and understand what the topic is about.

I've used adb and it was vaguely related to debugger acronyms so I assumed it would be debugger something. It does not matter to me what the exact name is.

That was before even mentioning the feature is adb, which yes, that is a security concern because you can bypass Android's security model. Why that's been open for so long in the first place is an even bigger story IMO. Regardless these app and cache killer apps are at best barely useful and often scams.

It's possible for large nations like USA and China to grow rice in heterogenous regions and meet domestic demand with rice grown in low-arsenic regions (California), and export rice grown in high-arsenic regions (Texas). That said, few people trust China to provide good numbers/testing/pro-active enforcement for consumer safety. They are good about applying very tough penalties (including personal executions/death penalty for corporate officers) after quality issues reach a certain level of public outcry.

Don't take rice from me! The recent lead contamination in apple sauce made me glad we have the FDA, but also wonder if the FDA is doing enough. I've ran across some political conspiracy theories about doing away with the FDA and similar organizations, and I think I should appreciate the FDA while I can. But also, why did it take a bunch of kids getting lead poisoning for the FDA to find that apple sauce had a lead problem? Systematically testing products from the stores seems like a low hanging fruit, one of the simplest and most effective means of regulating the food supply. Is this not happening? What is the FDA doing that is more important than performing regular checks of the food in stores for contaminants? Maybe I'm a pessimist, but if rice commonly does have unsafe levels of arsenic, I'm not confident that anyone will say or do anything until it becomes a tragedy. reply somenameforme 2 hours agorootparentYou're dramatically underestimating the amount of work that testing all foods would entail. It would be, at the minimum: every_single_type_of_food * every_production_point_of_said_food * every_manufacturing_point_of_said_food(e.g. restaurants) * every_test_to_run * frequency_to_test_at. That's a wildly exponential function. So the way the FDA (and most regulatory agencies in the US) works is by researching what they believe to be safe and then requiring companies agree to only use those methods/components. If a company does something else, they are required to provide evidence that they believe it is safe. The FDA then evaluates the provided evidence, rather than e.g. running labs/experiments/etc themselves. This drives numerous issues. For instance one is a 'generally recognized as safe' exception that allows companies to add entirely new components to their foods without even notifying the FDA. [1] Genetically engineered foods are another big one. A genetically engineered e.g. potato is, from the FDA's definitions, just a potato. And so it there's no further regulatory oversight or safety testing done whatsoever. The only thing they offer is a voluntary 'plant biotechnology consultation program.' [2] [1] - https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/04/14/399591292/wh... [2] - https://www.fda.gov/food/agricultural-biotechnology/how-gmos... reply reaperman 1 hour agorootparentI think removing \"every_manufacturing_point_of_said_food(e.g. restaurants)\" would suffice, and be would perfectly appropriate. We literally already do this for all exported and imported food. So it's not absurd at all. Also I think your variable naming is a bit off. Restaurants aren't generally considered manufacturers. reply bombcar 13 hours agorootparentprevIf you’re truly worried about rice consumption levels, you likely can order specialty rice from known locations that has less arsenic reply no_wizard 14 hours agorootparentprevThe bigger problem is we have a ton of regulatory overhead. The FDA and the USDA are both responsible for checking the safety of different parts of the food supply, and this causes issues. Instead of it being a clear priority for one agency it gets muddled in which agency should be looking at what. Then couple that with the fact that the FDA historically spends more time on drug safety than food safety and the USDA has conflicting priorities in many ways, combined together you end up with some real issues with catching things early and/or before they hit the market It could be solved by creating a single agency dedicated to food safety and removing the burden from two the agencies that have many other priorities on top of food safety. That in a tl;dr nutshell is the problem. There is a good overview of these dynamics done by Last Week Tonight that’s on YouTube I recommend for an overview: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Za45bT41sXg reply mh- 14 hours agorootparentThis sounds a lot like the justification for creating the DHS to encompass the historically-disjoint agencies. I don't disagree with you, but I worry that the result would end up providing food safety theatre, à la TSA. reply arcticbull 11 hours agorootparentI don’t think the theater resulted from the joining of the agencies but rather the change in mindset post 9/11 that led to the merger. Common root cause. reply bbarnett 14 hours agorootparentprevProbably fighting for the budget to do so. Certain political stances think that companies are the best people to curtail their own behavior. That inspections should never be done by the government. That no sane company would ever chase short term profit and stock price, over going bankrupt in 5 years, because they killed 1/2 their customers. So the FDA hasn't the budget to do random pulls I suspect. Of course, if you think of how many products are on grocery store shelves, pulling and testing 100k? 200k? products a week would be a budget indeed. reply jandrewrogers 14 hours agoparentprevIt mostly isn't a concern domestically. Americans don't eat nearly as much rice as Haitians, apparently. What constitutes a dangerous level of arsenic in the diet is controversial. First, arsenic is an essential micronutrient similar to selenium, and with a similar toxicity profile. There isn't much science to support the notion that the trace levels commonly found in food and water represent a health risk. Second, the recommended arsenic thresholds set by the government were the product of efforts by environmentalists to make opening new mines impractical by setting the standard below background environmental levels for many types of mining. This was sold under the theory that \"arsenic is toxic at any dose\" but per the first point, it clearly isn't. tl;dr: There was a lot of motivated reasoning and not much science behind the food and water arsenic recommended safe levels, and several regions of the planet are subject to significantly higher background levels with no ill effects. You definitely don't want to go out of your way to consume arsenic -- it is toxic at some dose -- but much of the discussion around the level of risk is misleading. reply fabian2k 13 hours agorootparentAs far as I understand there is no actual evidence that arsenic is an essential trace element for humans. There is some data in animals, but not in humans. reply laborcontract 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat a gross generalization of what Americans eat. My family eats rice with almost every meal. Given that, is this a concern domestically? Is it a concern for my toddler? reply jandrewrogers 14 hours agorootparentOf course it is a gross generalization, talking about the diet of any country usually is. While everyone is focused on rice, the other major bio-accumulator is brassica vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. Many parts of Asia consume large quantities of both plants daily as staples, which suggests that the risk is low in practice. reply hollerith 13 hours agorootparentYour Asia observation is relevant only if Asian levels of arsenic in the soil is comprable US levels, but I always thought levels in the soil in the southern US are an order of magnitude or 2 higher. reply stevenwoo 3 hours agorootparentprevDon’t buy rice from Texas or Mississippi. The Consumer Reports analysis other people are linking showed the former big cotton states had contaminated many of their rice fields with arsenic from cotton growing. reply kthartic 13 hours agorootparentprev> My family eats rice with almost every meal. I wouldn't say that's typical of most American households though. Ever heard of the Standard American Diet? reply TaylorAlexander 13 hours agorootparentI think the whole point is that an American who eats a lot of rice is not served by the answer “it’s not a problem, Americans don’t eat a lot of rice”. I think the people are trying to figure out if arsenic levels in rice will be a problem for them specifically, not our population as a whole. When they say “is that a problem here?” they mean “is the rice I am buying here of concern if I eat a lot of it?” reply aaomidi 13 hours agorootparentprevAmerica is extremely diverse. There is no “standard diet”. reply subpixel 13 hours agorootparentThere empirically is a standard American diet. Of course diversity also exists but it’s insignificant statistically.

Nearly every meal I have has rice. reply anonporridge 15 hours agoprevI'd be curious to see a study that weighs the health costs of too much arsenic, with the health costs of too few calories. It's not intrinsically obvious what the cost/benefit analysis is. Obviously, this assumes that if Haiti doesn't import bad rice from the US, their calories per capita would decrease or cost per calorie increase, which isn't necessarily the case. Also obviously, we should do everything we can to decrease arsenic content for healthier food. It's akin to the problem of our housing standards and regulations that are so high, that we struggle to build low cost housing that satisfies code, so instead tons of people end up living on the street. The perfect is the enemy of the good. reply bombcar 13 hours agoparentOne way we “split the eye of the needle’s onion” or whatever is differentiate on things you “do for others” and those you “do to yourself”. For example, relax building codes for work done by the homeowner - the problem comes when people sell. reply luckman212 13 hours agoprevNot trying to minimize the gravity of this situation, however I want to point out that soaking rice in water overnight prior to cooking, as well as cooking it in a larger quantity of water (excess water is drained off, rather than cooking with less water until rice is dry) has been tested to reduce arsenic levels by around 80%. I've been doing this for years, and once you make a habit out of it, it's really not a big deal. Makes me feel better about eating rice 2-3x per week.

While it was \"higher\" it was a low number and in many of their samples below the limits of detection. reply londons_explore 8 hours agoprev> The report called for an ethical investigation into U.S. rice exporters, It is common to grow rice, test it, and if it fails a test, then you sell it into another market where the test thresholds are different. However, this is unethical because safety thresholds are set imagining that different samples of a product will have different levels of contaminants. It is assumed that buyers will eat from different sources randomly. However, if some sellers are picking which country they sell to based on test results, then a market with a slightly higher safety threshold will in fact be flooded with much more contaminated products, on average.

This seems like a very strange way for a research paper to talk about chemical analyses. The Reuters article doesn’t cite the paper directly, but it’s here [0]. I note from their paper that rice from all non-Haitian origins, not just the US, contained what they describe as worrying levels of arsenic. I’m also confused by their (mislabeled) graphs attempting to suggest that the levels are routinely harmful. Those graphs all seem to reflect people whose bodies weigh between 8 and 20kg each eating 1.5 cups dry = 300g dry = 1kg cooked rice daily. That seems like a lot of rice for a baby to eat, but I don’t know what’s normal. What’s more, their graphs seem like they’re saying both local and imported rice would largely fall below the “cancer risk” threshold they show on one set of graphs, and both largely exceed the “non-cancer health outcome” thresholds they’re interested in. To top it off, in their conclusion, they mention that they know they’ve been measuring the wrong thing all along: they’re measuring total arsenic levels, while the standards they use refer to concentrations of inorganic arsenic. The EPA says that organic arsenic is nontoxic and harmless. [2] > By measuring only total arsenic levels, our measurements do not exactly correspond to thresholds set by Codex and the U.S. FDA, which are based on inorganic arsenic concentrations. A quick look at other widely-cited experimental research suggests that around 40% of the total arsenic in US rice is the harmful, inorganic kind [3]. And the remainder of the total arsenic count is the nontoxic organic kind. Which suggests that if the researchers at hand had measured the thing that was actually harmful, instead of including harmless things with a similar name, they’d find that all the rice in question was below the worrisome thresholds, even for the small humans they’re worried about. I wonder if the same policy agenda informs the rest of the editorial decisions at the “Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development.” A causal glance suggests an activist kind of flavor [1], but I don’t have much of a baseline on norms in the “food justice” discipline.

You just can't help a freezing person by setting fire to them. Giving people money for food raises the prices of food. Giving people free food ruins the people selling food.

If you want to distort an economy you have to do it intentionally and with great care with an eye for helping it grow. For example, look at what they already import from your country, buy it from your own producers and then sell it at a deep discount, but watch out for who else sells it and if you'll distort any other exporters markets. Look at their needs for capital equipment, especially where efficiency is involved and sell it to them cheaply, again paying attention to not trample existing markets.

And it is true: NGOs and \"aid\" that indiscriminately flood a market with cheap products under the lazy and foolish belief that giving away free stuff is a Good Thing does incredible damage to economies. It's one thing to distribute aid during a crisis. It's another to keep shipping free stuff indefinitely. In this case, free rice is having the effect of price dumping. You can't compete with free, so local agriculture and cuisine is being wrecked, and diets are changing for the worse. Another example is the distribution of so-called mitumba, where, say, ragpickers from New Jersey ship tons of used and second hand clothing to Africa, destroying the local textile industry. This, and intentional Chinese tactics (and probably American, among others), is how, for example, Nigerian cotton and textiles were destroyed. If you want a country to flourish, often it's a matter of fucking off and letting it develop. Investment is good, of course, as long as it's done on the basis of a partnership between labor and capital, not taking over and pumping and dumping competition so you can effectively colonize the country economically. Unregulated free trade is always promoted by the powerful, as they can easily swoop into developing economies and entrench themselves before the local industrial base even has a chance to establish itself. reply nonethewiser 14 hours agorootparent> but nitpicking when the meaning is clear (\"destructive\") But “destructive” and “violent “ aren’t synonymous.
