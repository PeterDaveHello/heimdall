The Drive literally went back to condition in May 2023 Hi, my Google Drive files suddenly disappeared. The Drive literally went back to condition in May 2023. data from May until today disappeared, and the folder structure went back to status in May. Google Drive activity doesn't show any changes (only show activity that was in May) No files was deleted manually, so no files in Trash. I never sync or shared my files and drive to anyone, I used the drive locally. I followed recovery process that Google support team ask me to (South Korea team). They put a recovery program and failed. ask me to backup and restore DriveFS folder, nothing changed. I reported the issue to the Google support team probably in States and they ask me to report the issue to their engineer. But no answer from the engineer and cannot know whether they are reviewing my issue. I used the drive few days ago and last morning this horrible problem happened. very devastating and the files are very important to me. needs any help to fix the problem. thanks in advance for any helps Details Drive for Desktop , Windows Reply I have the same question (65) Subscribe Community content may not be verified or up-to-date.

In this case there is nothing we can do. If support have tried recovery, we don't have any other options other than to suggest you try and escalate the second support ticket. Good luck, Peter 4 More comments Yeonjoong Original Poster 5 days ago This cannot be a coincidence... I think Google Drive have a serious problem, not user problem. You could just search Google Drive Support and find 'contact us' to get support, but in my case not that helpful. PeteranDi Diamond Product Expert Peter, volunteer contributor Photos and Drive 4 days ago @User 10333924321735401250, you mentioned that \"My files were deleted back to April 2023 when it was last synced\" Why is it 7 months since they were last synced? Add a comment 1 More B Bryan Adrian 5 days ago Same thing happened to me too. I'm devastated right now because the missing files dated back >3 months ago. Our IT team try to contact google support but no solution yet. Hopefully the files can be restored 3 More comments B Bryan Adrian 4 days ago Is it possible to restore the data from cached files within my google drive? I have checked on \"Managed offline files\" on google drive desktop and there were 0 bytes of offline files but there were 114 MB of cached files. I also checked on C:\\Users\\xxx\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\DriveFS (my local cached files directory) and there were plenty of data there that I couldn't understand. Maybe those 114 MB were my desperately needed files.. If you know something about this, please kindly help me.

If you want to reference my case number from Support: case ID: 7-5779000034938 Google are denying responsibility for this data being wiped -_- Add a comment N Niko Coraccio 4 days ago Like many, same exact issue. I'm guessing there was a point where all my files stopped syncing for some reason - but google drive still worked fine. I do still have the cache, which now that I think about it appears to be around the same size as google drive, but you said that a recovery using that failed, so I don't know. Really hope google finds a fix to this soon. PeteranDi Diamond Product Expert Peter, volunteer contributor Photos and Drive 4 days ago @Niko, see reply to Anthony. Don't disconnect your account is case there is a way to restore access to the cache, I have asked the question. Add a comment N Niko Coraccio 4 days ago Did you happen to update Windows before this? Mine logged me out after the update, so I was wondering if that was the cause for everyone. 1 More comment N Niko Coraccio 4 days ago Peter, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UvFS1b5hNJF7v0Ie3whnrTZ44Jd-pkuu/view?usp=sharing Hope this helps. PeteranDi Diamond Product Expert Peter, volunteer contributor Photos and Drive 4 days ago Thanks Niko Add a comment A Anthony Vohl 4 days ago I have also lost months of work data from this same situation. I found a potential solution on redirecting to a cache file but Google Support weren't able to replicate (https://support.google.com/a/thread/8691300?hl=en) they said they can't replace cache data. If anyone can figure this out I am desperate to recover these unsynced files!! PeteranDi Diamond Product Expert Peter, volunteer contributor Photos and Drive 4 days ago @Anthony, the format of the cached files appears to be just a rename, for example I had some large *.jpg photos renamed in cache that I was able to change back to the *.jpg and the original photo was intact. My files are ad-hoc in C:\\Users\\Peter\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\DriveFS\\108612279568304291166\\content_cache where the Users name and long number is unique to each user. It might be worth copying the contents to another location and searching for *.* to see if there is anything possible. B Bryan Adrian 8 hr. ago This method does not work for me. But thank you Peter for your answer Add a comment J Julia_Ana_k 3 days ago This also happened to us today. Even files that were uploaded through the web interface by my team over the last year all vanished. Not only my Drive on Desktop files. This is super super bad, as all of our companies files are lying there... PeteranDi Diamond Product Expert Peter, volunteer contributor Photos and Drive 3 days ago Hello Julia, Your company must have an Admin and a Sales contact. I urge you to get them to raise tickets with Support and escalate immediately. I strongly recommend that no 'standard' reset/reinstall/disconnect is carried out without a full discussion with support escalation. Other users are seeing their offline cache available but not being accessed. Peter Add a comment U User 18316101495719567270 3 days ago The exact same thing happened to me when Drive updated. All of my files modified or created since May have disappeared. 1000s of files and folders. Support has been working on it for a over a week. Apparently Google Drive kept a backup of my streaming cache in the DriveFS app data folder on my C drive, but support is still researching how to restore it. 12 More comments U User 18316101495719567270 20 hr. ago Google Support decided to not show up to the call THEY scheduled this morning.

I have had the same problem occur today. This is going to cause me major issues if I cannot get the files back. It's all my work for the last 1-2 years. All my business work, all my personal files. Everything, just vanished. It must be 100's of files suddenly gone. Really worried about this and how I can get them back. These are for important projects I am working on and have worked on.

All files added to Google Drive for Desktop since around May 2023 have disappeared. It is like they were never synced to the cloud. No sign of them in Google Vault etc... We have a support case going with Google. We are hoping this is recoverable as there is potentionally months of work lost for this staff member. Add a comment U User 10016509750976794660 8 hr. ago We've had exactly the same issue since last Monday with data from May 2023 suddenly gone. As an example a file our user was working on Monday was suddenly no where to be found on Tuesday. No audit logs showing the user deleted anything, restore did not help.

In some ways, it’s nice for there to be a responsive community, but in other ways, I think a trillion dollar company should pay for excellent customer service.E.g. in this case their volunteer customer service is left with this and there is no way to even know if Google sees this:“Sorry Yeonjoong,As a group of volunteers, we do not have access to user accounts and can only help by sharing our experiences. In this case there is nothing we can do. “ reply sangnoir 4 hours agoparent> As an aside, I am curious the motivation for customers to staff huge company support forumsMy guess is it&#x27;s the same motivation for those who volunteer to help others in any other support forum. Human nature does not change based on the market cap of the company (if any) behind the product. What difference do you expect between this, and Stack Overflow contributors for Microsoft SQL Server or Blender? I wouldn&#x27;t expect there to be a difference in motivation: some people simply enjoy helping others (even if it&#x27;s in return of made-up internet points). reply freetanga 2 hours agorootparentI think Market Cap relates -loosely- to financial capacity of the company to have employees playing the support role.On the paying tiers of FAANG-like, Is crazy that these companies charge market price for their services yet the support is usually quite poor. reply latency-guy2 43 minutes agorootparentFor a minor explanation, support is just prohibitively expensive no matter what you do, and quite frankly the only people actually capable of support is going to be the devs who made the product for various bugs&#x2F;issues, and that is just a handful of people, some of whom have left the company even.Finding good support is also hard. I worked in product areas with dedicated support for paying customers, and the number of support staff that I would consider actually helpful is precisely 3 people, out of a few hundred. Those 3 people are paid a ton to keep them around, and while I don&#x27;t know exactly what they&#x27;re paid they usually get moved up and into a role that at minimum exceeds typical senior eng pay, the rest just bounce tickets back and forth collecting traces with at best a poor understanding of the product. On average no understanding.Another problem is that a good support staff would probably do better to be a dev anyway, the knowledge required is pretty much the same, just missing development experience. reply Scoundreller 1 hour agorootparentprevA lot of people have forgotten that you can actually call companies and they do&#x2F;will assist.Called Walmart and they got extra bike racks installed at my location. Have had to call eBay a number of times as a small-time seller. PayPal too. Got Google to replace my chromecast remote and they went through thorough troubleshooting steps before RMAing it.Of course, there are plenty of exceptions but not worth pretending that paid (by the vendor) support doesn’t exist. reply bbarnett 1 hour agorootparentI believed, until you said PayPal support was helpful. PayPal support is what I envision the DMV in Soviet Russia was like.The outcome is support that makes you feel like you&#x27;re bothering them, is barely concealing their hostility, lies about what&#x27;s happening, and one wrong word and horrible, horrible things will happen to you.That&#x27;s PayPal support on the best of days, like after the support person just received a 20% raise, or had a baby.

Maybe not in cases like this but quite a few times I&#x27;ve googled an issue with a google&#x2F;microsoft product, found a post on their forums with an answer from a Verified Service Technician or something like that saying \"Update your drivers, run sfc &#x2F;scannow, and turn it off and on again\", then run the same search with \"reddit\" at the end and got an actual answer reply android42 4 hours agorootparentprevSame here, especially since most of the time it&#x27;s an unhelpful answer that dodges the actual problem or generic advice that doesn&#x27;t apply, then they mark it as solved.Which then furthers the question, why? I could understand the odd person just trying to be helpful because they had the same problem, found the post with no solution, figured it out, then answered with theirs, but for the ones who seem to spend countless hours ranking up, either by gaming it, or the few actually being helpful, does it lead to a chance of being hired or something?Creating a system like that almost feels like it should be illegal, almost like the companies that give extensive case studies for interviews and take the work with no intention of hiring the interviewees, or unpaid internships where they don&#x27;t even bother teaching and just give grunt work. reply Faark 2 hours agorootparentprevHaving done pretty much this a lifetime ago: A lot of the first level bug support work is basically deduplication (Incl \"have you tried...\") and asking for aditional&#x2F;specific information.

The \"accepted answer\" was one of these support volunteers who was based in Europe and all they had done was regurgitated the support article and pretended it was an authoritative answer. They added no value whatsoever and caused the thread to be over thanks to their \"accepted answer\".I was confused why someone had wasted their time doing this, so I snooped around a bit.

After all, Google products are still being used after they fired large amount of support staff (not that support experience was good with them). It&#x27;s a good example for other corporations to do the same - it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;ll go elsewhere, riiiight?

Most of the people do it because it gives them a sense of importance and authority. reply YPPH 4 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s frankly infuriating when you get generic responses from someone who has no internal systems access, means to address the problem, or ability to escalate to an engineer.Often these purported super users reply with silly generic suggestions, or meaningless requests for information. There&#x27;s nothing worse than posting highly specific debugging information to a forum, which is not read by engineers, and is instead replied to by someone suggesting you try logging out and in again.For example, in this thread, \"Device\", \"Drive for desktop version\", and \"Sync mode\" isn&#x27;t remotely relevant to restoring user files. And the super user cannot do anything with that information. If that information is truly necessary, a Google engineer can post in the thread requesting it.And they do it all for a meaningless diamond badge. You may as well have AI doing it. reply vlovich123 4 hours agorootparentI think that&#x27;s because Google teams are failing to engage properly with the community volunteers. When I was at Cloudflare I engaged directly with the external community moderators on Discord and made sure they felt comfortable DM&#x27;ing me or mentioning me if they wanted to escalate a thread to my attention (this is separate from them having formal community manager contact points which I&#x27;m sure Google does). Google engineers just don&#x27;t care & there&#x27;s no incentive structure at Google to improve things + Google management probably views this as \"these people aren&#x27;t paying us enough & engineering time is expensive\". My counter here is that I viewed the entire class of non enterprise customers (free tier or tiny customers not paying for support) as a whole class that&#x27;s 1 enterprise customer in aggregate. Yes it costs some money, but in practice not that much & there&#x27;s non-monetary value you can extract doing that that offsets that cost.That being said, I understand what the Google Drive team is going through here & as long as they are aware, the support threads aren&#x27;t going to be useful until they root cause the issue & hopefully fix what happened. reply ValentineC 3 hours agorootparentprev> And they do it all for a meaningless diamond badge.Some of them get invited to Product Expert Summits too:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;google&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9vqyf0&#x2F;attended_the... reply Mistletoe 4 hours agorootparentprevIt’s so frustrating when you Google your problem and you read some Google or Apple or Microsoft product support page and see people like this responding.

People think about them as \"I have it on my local computer and in the cloud, so I&#x27;m much safer\".A lot of bad things can happen that are even invisible to the user until they find out data is missing.You save a file on a disk, something goes wrong with the cloud client, especially on bad connection and your file is either never synced (you will lose it on OS reinstall) or even deleted on your side.Cloud provider has some issues, they restore the backup and things are synced back on your computer to their restored state.Cloud provider started to dislike a file (their antivirus marked it), so they remove it from their side and it syncs to your computer. But that was a false positive (well, you could have your reasons to keep the infected file as well).Ok, I know, at least for Google Drive their official client is pretty well written (I was using it for a long time), but bugs happen.Conclusion?

I have it set to \"Download Remote Changes Only\" and always have; and while a software bug there could have caused it, the files that re-appeared were long, long deleted to me, everywhere, and I didn&#x27;t have copies of them on the NAS.

Now Is The Best Time To Switch To Firefox Choose the browser that best suits your privacy needs. 2023-11-20 Your choice of web browser is the crucial link between yourself and the world wide web. When you purchase a new device it typically comes pre-installed with a browser like Microsoft's Edge, Apple's Safari, or Google's Chrome. But these browsers may not fit your personal privacy needs, particularly since Chrome is going to show more ads in the future. When choosing the browser remember that via this browser you access your entire online identity. It is crucial to use a private browser to protect yourself and your data - and we'll help you pick the best one! SIGN UP Why Choose a Private Browser? Every site you visit tracks you in one way or the other, some sites require an account to view their content, others require allowing cookies, and this information is vacuumed up by web advertising agencies whose existence is predicated upon turning your browsing behavior into a product for marketing executives. We already know how Gmail scans your email content, but what advertisers and others are doing with your browser data is a black box. The advertising industry likes to not talk about how tracking your entire online behaviour enables them to create profiles about yourself, your family, friends, and colleagues, and how this data helps them to post targeted ads to maximize the profits they can get - simply from harvesting your data. But you have the power to stop this! Mainstream browsers like Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer - these are all browsers to avoid as they do not respect your privacy. Better pick Firefox instead! Today we will go ahead and take a look at a number of privacy-oriented web browsers outside those provided by Big Tech, which treat you like a human being and not a bullseye for targeted advertisement revenue. Let's dive into it! For our purposes we will be dividing the browsers into three categories: Mainstream Privacy, Alternative Privacy, and Top Anonymity. If you would like to run some of these comparisons yourself or even just make a quick privacy-checkup the EFF has released a great tool called Cover Your Tracks which can be used to see what information your browser may be sharing with websites and organizations interested in your online activity. After running this test, I am sure you will be so creeped out, you'll want to switch to a private browser right away! We will take a look at the unique features provided by each browser along with some pros and cons of adopting them. Pick the Best Private Browser Our Top 10 Browser List: Firefox DuckDuckGo Tor Browser Mullvad Pale Moon Puffin GNU IceCat WaterFox Brave Hyphanet Mainstream Privacy No. 1 Firefox: The Best for Basic Privacy When it comes to open source alternatives to Big Tech web browsers like Chrome or Safari it is hard to go wrong with Mozilla's Firefox. First introduced as Firefox in 2004, the browser quickly grew in popularity as an alternative to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The browser continued to grow and met its major challenger when Google introduced Chrome. At present Firefox is the fourth most popular web browser behind the three leading Big Tech browsers. Firefox boasts a great deal of privacy advantages over the mainstream default browsers. First of all, it is owned and developed by a non-profit so tracking user data is not their primary source of revenue. Firefox also releases its code as open source meaning that it is open for the world to see, so you know exactly what the browser is doing when running on your machine. Recent versions of Mozilla's browser have also introduced a powerful number of features which can streamline your online experience. They currently offer a password manager, page translation, anti-fingerprint tracking and ad-blocking, multi-device sync so that you don't lose your tabs and bookmarks when juggling devices, and Mozilla has also introduced their own VPN service in a partnership with Mullvad. But where Firefox really shines is with its massive library of browser extensions. One of the more interesting privacy specific extensions provided with this browser is the Facebook Container extension, which explicitly blocks any Facebook tracking cookies which may be trying to track your online activities. This will not stop Facebook from tracking your behavior on their own websites, but any of their off-site tracking attempts will be blocked. One sad point here is that the container only applies to Facebook and not other known trackers. This can be improved by adding other extensions to your browser like Privacy Badger from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Firefox also offers a Multi-Account Container extension so that your data is not shared across tabs. This extension isolates the activity between open browser tabs. This way your behavior on Instagram does not directly influence the results seen in your Amazon shopping tab. The browser also ships with their Enhanced Tracking Protection in the desktop application which stops cross-site tracking attempts in their tracks. The greatest strength of Firefox is its flexibility. Users can add privacy enhancing features as needed by simply adding extensions to their browser. While not perfect, Firefox is a great start for those of you who might be trying to take their first steps beyond the Big Tech ecosystem. Their VPN service has also increased the all-in-one value of Firefox. If you love Firefox and are looking to step your privacy game up a notch there are loads of forks with even more privacy oriented features. No. 2 DuckDuckGo: Best Search & Email Protection DuckDuckGo's famous private search has grown into something even better. DuckDuckGo now offers their own web browser which is available on MacOS, Windows, Android, and iOS. The browser blocks third-party trackers by default and allows you to fully clear the browser of all session data with a single stylized click. One great feature of DuckDuckGo Browser is their automatic cookie declining feature: When you visit a new website instead of being bombarded with banners asking you to either accept or reject cookies, the browser will automatically reject them and close the invasive pop-up with no need for user interaction! The browser also blocks site pop-ups asking you to sign into services using Google. The DDG browser also comes with DuckPlayer which can provide a smooth ad-free way of watching YouTube videos, and they have recently announced an upcoming VPN service. Beyond protecting you through the browser alone DuckDuckGo also offers an email privacy protection service. This service allows you to create an @duck.com email alias addresses which can be used for signing up for services you may not wish to give your primary email address to. It also allows you to automatically create \"private\" randomized Duck addresses which can be easily blocked or deleted when you no longer need them. DuckDuckGo is great browser with some nice additional features which protect you beyond your browser. Their built-in extra features like email protection are a refreshing open source response to Safari's Big Tech email protections. No. 4 Mullvad Browser: Best Built-in VPN Support Mullvad has a long standing place as VPN provider that truly cares about its users and their privacy. With a zero-log policy and proven transparency, Mullvad has been providing a secure VPN service since 2009. Earlier this year, Mullvad and the Tor Project teamed up to release a browser custom built with all the privacy settings of the Tor Browser, but which is configured to tunnel traffic through Mullvad's VPN instead of the onion network. This not only gives great advantages in connection speeds and performance, but the traffic is less likely to be blocked if a website is suspicious of known Tor exit node IP addresses. When using Mullvad browser, your browser fingerprint matches that of other Mullvad users, in the same way that the Tor browser does. All third-party trackers you may come across while surfing the web are blocked with uBlock Origin (also available as a Firefox extension) and the browser itself does not collect any telemetry data. According to the team at Mullvad this partnership with the Tor Project solved a longstanding issue in creating a private internet experience, namely that of a truly private browser. What stands out the most about Mullvad browser is the level of trust possible with their company. Mullvad has a proven track record of not logging user data. When presented with a search warrant in 2023 and asked to turn over user data, Mullvad could not comply with the request because there was no information available. This is the greatest example of precisely why zero-logging is important for online privacy. For users who need all of the privacy provided by the Tor Browser, but are looking for a bit more speed, Mullvad Browser is a great choice for protecting yourself online. No. 9 Brave: A Step Beyond Released in 2018, Brave Browser is built with privacy in mind. The team at Brave wanted to approach internet advertising in a new way and their built-in adblock and anti-tracking software thins down the onslaught of ads, while presenting the user with \"optional\" ads which they can view in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens. They were one of the first browsers to introduce support for .onion websites and the browser can navigate through the Tor network with no additional steps. Brave Browser comes out of the box with many privacy-oriented features installed. These include multiple cryptocurrency features like a built-in wallet, a privacy protecting suite called Brave Shield, a video chat application Brave Talk which is built upon the open source project Jitsi, and they have recently introduced a VPN service. One unique aspect of Brave Browser is that they randomize your browser fingerprint when visiting a new site. This fights back against cross-site tracking which can profile you while browsing through the internet. Their privacy Shield combines features you can only get on Firefox by adding certain extensions like NoScript and HTTPSEverywhere. Brave is built upon Chromium, which may turn some of the more vehement anti-Googlers away. There have also been some questionable business practices by the company, such as pushing their paid VPN service out to browsers without informing users and their cryptocurrency involvement that may be an issue for some users. In addition, the company was called out in 2020 for auto-completing URL with affiliate links they profited from. Overall, Brave seems like a solid choice in the privacy space, but some do not like its involvement in the crypto scene. Alternative Privacy The first four browsers are well-known options within the online privacy space. The next few browsers are smaller projects which deserve their time in the spotlight for their unique approach to online privacy. No. 6 Puffin Puffin Secure Browser aims to set themselves as your cloud-powered internet browser. Their cloud servers operate as a proxy that stands between your web browser and the world wide web. When sites try to track your online behavior, they see the accumulated behavior of many users which turns your personal browser fingerprint into a giant smeared mess of data. This proxy-based remote browser has the great cybersecurity advantage that your local machine is not interacting directly with any websites which may be hosting malicious code. This remote-browser functionality is not only a shining pearl, one notable downside to this system is that end users need to place their full trust in Puffin. Their centralized cloud-to-web functionality also makes their servers a potential man-in-the-middle attack threat. Another drawback is the lack of iOS support. The browser removed the full browser from iOS and it is currently only available in a limited version. Where they do make up for this is being one of the first browsers to take the leap to programming specifically for smart TVs. Most people have a smart TV at home, but the software installed doesn't come with privacy in mind. Having a privacy-focused group working to protect this new technology is a nice step towards improving online privacy and security. The Firefox Spin-Offs There is no debating that people love Firefox. Some folks have taken this love to a new level and have developed a number of different forks which claim to provide more privacy than vanilla Firefox. A major perk of these browsers is that they are all open source projects which offer full code transparency. As such they are not driven by generating profits, but are solely focused on making the web a free and safe digital space. No. 5 PaleMoon PaleMoon's motto is \"Your browser, Your way\" and their web browser does just that. With PaleMoon you can fully customize your browser experience with a number of non-Firefox add-ons. The browser also restricts itself to running as a single process on your local machine, unlike Firefox which spills over into multiple processes. PaleMoon's focus is to provide a stable and efficient browsing experience which can run on modern hardware as well as legacy hardware without dropping in performance. The project's main website provides extensions, add-ons, layout themes, and language packs which allow you the user to build yourself the browser you have always wished for. No. 7 GNU Ice Cat (formerly IceWeasel) Originally forked from Mozilla's Firefox as IceWeasel, GNU IceCat is a privacy-focused fork which aims to create an entirely free browser. All code is open for review and tinkering, and it has pushed itself forward as trademark resistant, inline with their goal of creating free software. IceCat also has a few security improvements that don't come stock in Firefox. The most interesting of these are the automatic blocking of tracking images which may phone home to inform someone that you have viewed some kind of content. The browser also prevents non-free Javascript from running when a page is loaded, again keeping true to their assertion that software should be free. If you have a strong philosophical commitment to free software it is hard to go wrong with GNU IceCat. No. 8 Waterfox Waterfox is another Firefox fork which aims to protect its users by disabling telemetry which is gathered by the Firefox browser. The browser also disables the Pocket feature which comes installed in Mozilla's browser. Waterfox is compatible with the massive volume of extensions available to not only Firefox, but also to Chrome and Opera. One nice feature that is included is the ability to open private browser tabs without needing to open an entirely new browser window. This makes navigating the web a much smoother experience. One feature which sets Waterfox apart from the others is its Oblivious DNS which protects your online activity from the eyes of your ISP. Private and Anonymous Private and anonymous - these words are often jumbled together when people are talking about online security, but they are not the same. Something being private, does not mean that you are anonymous, nor does anonymity automatically mean something is private. Bitcoin transactions are technically anonymous, but are not private if anyone can view them at any time. There are two more browsers on our list which take the jump from private towards true anonymity: Tor Browser and Hyphanet. No. 3 Tor Browser: When Anonymity is Key When it comes to online privacy the Tor Browser reigns supreme. With a number of features which prevent online tracking and fingerprinting, protections against malicious Javascript code, and the ability to route your traffic through the Tor network provide users with an unparalleled degree of privacy and anonymity. The Tor Browser works by routing your web traffic through a number of volunteer operated relays which mask your IP address. Each relay only knows the connection of the sending node and by the time your request reaches its final destination, the website will only see the IP of your randomly determined exit node. One advantage of using the Tor network, compared to other I2P solutions, is that you can surf the clearweb in addition to .onion sites hosted within the Tor network itself. The Tor Browser allows activists, journalists, and political dissidents to communicate securely and freely. The Tor Project, the development team behind Tor, is a non-profit organization and is not dependent upon generating ad revenue for support. Operated by volunteers and donations, the Tor Project can operate freely to protect online privacy and human rights around the globe. The biggest downside to using the Tor Browser is that it tends to be slower than a standard web browser. When routing traffic through the various relays which exist around the globe, the traffic will be throttled to the speed of the slowest connection. Due to malicious activity, some sites will automatically block users from connecting via the Tor network, but many others have created .onion sites. The New York Times, BBC, and even Facebook have created .onion sites so that you can securely access their sites via Tor no matter where you are. No. 10 Hyphanet: I2P for You and Me Hyphanet, formerly known as Freenet, is its own peer-to-peer internet which focuses on providing a censorship-resistance platform for secure and anonymous online communication. Hyphanet is used to visit \"freesites\" which are hosted throughout the peer-to-peer network, similar to how Tor hidden services are only accessible through the Tor Browser. Users communicate through decentralized nodes which relay traffic between users. All data is encrypted both on the end users device and on the nodes themselves to ensure that it remains secure. Hyphanet's goal is fighting censorship and protecting the freedom of expression. By operating in a decentralized manner, they are able to connect citizens living in oppressive regimes to those outside their borders and help them spread news which would otherwise be silenced. Hosting on Hyphanet is easy and anyone can create a \"freesite\" which they can use to make their voice heard. This data, not being centrally hosted, is stored in an encrypted partition of the user's hard drive and is edited based upon the popularity of the content. Hyphanet's features of webhosting, chats, and search all operate by utilizing some of the end users bandwidth and device storage. For some users, this data being stored on their device is a major red flag because they do not know exactly what kind of material is being stored on their personal devices. Final Ratings Let's get down to brass tacks. The best private browser totally depends on what your needs and interests are. If you are an avid VPN fan, then built-in VPN support will be a priority. If you cannot stand the thought of touching proprietary software, GNU IceCat is a better choice. I, myself, would give the following recommendations, one for the average user just looking for an easy-to-use daily browsing experience and the other for those in need of extreme privacy. Best for General Privacy: Mozilla's Firefox With its nearly endless number of privacy enhancing extensions, expanding list of extra features like VPN support and file sharing, and a strong commitment to opensource software, Firefox takes the top spot in our best private browsers recommended for the general user. Their auditable code lets us feel secure that there is nothing nefarious going on behind the browser window and their status as a non-profit also assures us that Mozilla is putting the user experience first, not their profit margin. Firefox is also a private browsing solution not built upon Google's Chromium, which is a nice perk for those of us seeking to distance ourselves from anything Google. With Firefox you can start surfing the web privately right after installing the software. Any additional needs that might arise are easily met by installing extensions or add-ons like uBlock Origin, which is going to be broken in Google Chrome with upcoming changes. There are also a number of great extensions for Firefox available from the Electronic Frontier Foundation which can help you strengthen your browser's privacy. The vast amount of customization options available in Firefox make it our all-around best private browser as it can easily be configured to fit the unique security needs of each user. Best for General Usage: DuckDuckGo We picked DuckDuckGo for their number of great features, adblocking, anti-tracking, email protections, and their soon to come VPN. DuckDuckGo is available with a dedicated application for most devices including mobile. It plays nice with the vast majority of websites without breaking or slowing down. It also provides a smooth YouTube experience without interrupting you with ads every 30 seconds. We are looking forward to seeing what kind of progress they make in the future. (Full disclosure, I have been using DDG since they first introduced their mobile apps and have yet to have a negative experience with them.) Best For Maximum Privacy: Tor Browser If your threat model requires anonymity, the Tor Browser is hard to beat. Built for privacy and anonymity, your communications will remain secure and will be difficult to link to your person. Many major new organizations have created .onion sites so that sources can contact them to make sure that important news reaches global discussion. The Tor Browser is operated by volunteers around the world who make sure that the network remains operational and if one node gets shut down, another can keep running and moving traffic. While it may not be the best for streaming YouTube videos while making dinner, Tor is a necessary tool for activists, journalists, whistleblowers and many more. What do you think of our ratings? Is your favorite browser missing from this list? Did we overlook some key features that may have impacted our rating? If so, please reach out to us on our social media pages and let us know. We are always eager to learn more from the privacy community. By working together we can make the internet a safer place for everyone.

What amazes me is how quick they transitioned to Google Chrome when it released. This was around 2009.It amazes me how quick people jump to something especially when it has a big company behind advertising it.I see this a lot in my career as well (software engineer) - when some cool, flashy new toy comes backed by companies like Microsoft, Google, Sun&#x2F;Oracle. etc.Anyway..

That seems hard to believe.I stuck with FF until around 2016 or so before being compelled to switch. The performance was just very clearly worse than Chrome&#x27;s at the time. Not sure what the state of things is now.This is HN, so another huge reason to use Chrome is for the devtools, which I&#x27;ve always had a very good experience with and know pretty well. I&#x27;ve always found other browser devtools miserable to work with in the past, though I admit I haven&#x27;t invested serious time into learning them.All that said, the adblocking fiasco may well get me to try out FF again as my daily browser. But personally I had very clear reasons for abandoning it originally, it wasn&#x27;t just cargo cutting reply pitdicker 30 minutes agorootparentThere was a lot of talk about Firefox having poor performance, but I have never experienced any of it. For daily use Firefox has always been one of the more responsive applications on my PC.If you experienced poor performance the common explanation at the time was that you either had a profile folder that had accumulated all sorts of stuff that somehow caused a slowdown, or had some unfortunate extensions installed. reply cuSetanta 7 minutes agorootparentprevBuilt in translation is a big one that I rarely see mentioned.I was long time fan of FF while living in Ireland and the UK, but when I moved to Sweden and later Germany I was effectively forced to switch to Chrome.Being required to interact with websites in other languages regularly meant that FF (circa 2018) was just not an option. The chrome experience for translating webpages was vastly superior to any other browser, which I needed to use 3rd party translating apps to get anywhere. These were clunky, low performance black boxes that I tried to live with and failed.I see now that other browsers are starting to properly do built-in translation, but Chrome was way ahead for a long time.

Firefox really was a slow browser in that time, especially with lots of tabs open. It was only with the Quantum (?) engine that FF became a lot faster.

At least that&#x27;s how I remember it so many years later.So, convenient that they pushed something that half the web and browsers didn&#x27;t pay much attention to, but they did because they wanted interactive apps and things inside a browser. And hey, this was at the time fancy UIs and frameworks were popping up. Were they prescient or just riding the wave? Or were they perhaps doing that plus also pushing the wave in the direction that best suited what they were good at and also made them lots of money in advertising.So when we say marketing, we have to include all that advertising now just for a browser, but also for everything that google was pushing in synergy with it. reply jona-f 11 minutes agoparentprevI&#x27;ve been a melancholic Firefox user since it was called Netscape...Tried Brave on my phone, but it managed to generate 90mb of network traffic in 10min where another browser takes 5mb.

Firefox developer tools are not as convenient to me and Firefox does not support WebUSB which I need for some tasks. Also I always found Firefox filled with little irritating bugs when I tried to switch to it.That said, I&#x27;m not convinced by this flashmob against Chrome. I like Google direction and Google philosophy behind Chrome, including its position on adblockers. So I hardly have any reason to switch to Firefox. Chromium is open source, Firefox is financed by Google, so it&#x27;s hard for me to be convinced that Chrome somehow is bad. Especially when Firefox makes one bad move after another bad move (integrating weird third-party services within Browser, like Pocket or VPN or whatever).And, yeah, I don&#x27;t care about my privacy that much, especially not on the level to actively fight for it. I care about security, and that&#x27;s about it. reply olavgg 26 minutes agorootparentMost people don&#x27;t need features like WebUSB support.But I do believe people want uBlock to intercept http requests before rendering the web page. And from my understanding this has always been supported in Firefox, but never in Chrome.I have used Firefox forever, I never switched to Chrome as it knew it never was fully open-source. The point of open source is that you&#x27;re able to build the thing from sources with the exact functionality as in binary file they release.The web is extremly important for everyone, and it is important that we still build an open web for everyone. When people use projects like Chrome, they let Google decide the direction of the web, just like Microsoft did with IE.That Firefox was sometimes slower than Chrome and sometimes lacked features has never been a big productivy hit for me. Neither has web pages that didn&#x27;t work in Firefox. In the worst cases I just need to start Chromium. I lose max 1 minute.

I&#x27;m not sure why you are amazed with Chrome transition, but let me give insights from experience.We had Firefox 0.3 which was very, very slow browser but still much better than Internet Explorer. There was a lot of mental gymnastics involved to get pages display at least similar for both browsers.When Chrome 1 was released, it was absolutely awesome. Minimal interface. Focused on browsing. Incredibly fast, it just executed JS stupidly quick and we could create web app interfaces that didn&#x27;t lagYou can still download Chrome 1 and see what it&#x27;s about. It was basically what users wanted: supports more CSS features than other browsers, starts fast, executes JS fast, provides adequate developer console, renders pages correctly.It took all of us by storm because it was genuinely good software. That era was the era of good software, not spam advertising.Today, in 2023. this is not true any more and you are entirely correct when asking why people would use Chrome. Answer is: laziness, lack of info, apathy, lack of knowledge. reply bad_user 1 hour agoprevI keep seeing Edge mentioned as a worthy alternative, and I just don&#x27;t get it.First, all Chromium-based browsers will eventually block uBlock Origin for the sole reason that they can&#x27;t maintain Manifest v2 on their own, and they all rely on Chrome&#x27;s Web Store anyway. This won&#x27;t happen immediately because Manifest v2 will probably stick around for longer because of enterprise users, but the writing is on the wall.Then there&#x27;s the fact that Edge is just Microsoft&#x27;s spyware, being worse in my book than Google&#x27;s Chrome. And people forget that Microsoft is also an advertising company. Even if that&#x27;s not their main revenue source, they also hate your ad-blockers.In the EU, when you open Edge for the first time, they ask you to agree to sharing your personal data with the entire advertising industry, via an IAB dialog. And there&#x27;s no way to workaround it, you have to answer it (with the rejection being an agreement to “legitimate interest” claims, which are BS). Google&#x27;s Chrome does not do this, and searching on google.com only asks for sharing of data with Google itself.Edge also exposes an advertising ID, meant for Bing&#x27;s Ads, much like what Chrome does for Google. And in true Microsoft spirit, it also has telemetry, which you can&#x27;t turn off.Edge doesn&#x27;t end-to-end encrypt your synchronized data. Compared with Chrome, which at least supports an “encryption passphrase” that does e2e encryption. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Chrome is also cursed because with a passphrase, they don&#x27;t synchronize all your history. And also, they keep turning on that option for sharing your browsing history with Google, for the purpose of improving search. But in terms of what browser is more adversarial towards users, Edge is worse, IMO.And Edge is hard-coded to use Bing. It&#x27;s harder to use Edge without Bing or Microsoft&#x27;s online services, than it is to use Chrome without Google. Personally, I don&#x27;t want my browser to tie me to certain online services.Seriously, Edge is just Microsoft&#x27;s spyware and a piece of crap. Other Chromium alternatives, like Vivaldi or Brave, are better, firstly because they aren&#x27;t so adversarial. Or if you&#x27;re on macOS, give Arc a try. reply asmor 39 minutes agoparentPeople who don&#x27;t see the problem with Edge must all be domain joined or on Pro for Workstations &#x2F; Enterprise.

Despite me clicking no every time, it still occasionally disables it. I think there may be a timeout, and then the disabled plugin syncs everywhere.* Asked me if it could shouldersurf my Kagi searches and scrape them to improve Bing. If I was Kagi, I&#x27;d think about blocking the Edge user agent.* Upon clicking \"no\" on the point above, it changed my search engine to Bing.* Edge also has a feature to regularly scrape other Browsers for their history to submit to Microsoft.

It did have some tricks, but “energy saver” and “memory saver” modes have been added to Chromium. reply jillesvangurp 35 minutes agoprevUse whatever makes you happy.But it&#x27;s worth pointing out that Chrome and Chromium are developed by Google. The whole point of using Chromium as a browser developer (Brave, Edge, Opera, ...) is to have Google own and take care of all the difficult bits, drive the technical roadmap, and decide on what is and isn&#x27;t going to be in the next version. So, you don&#x27;t gain much by switching to those as the teams behind those Chromium based alternatives don&#x27;t actually develop most of the browser and you are not really cutting loose from Google. Brave does a little more than others but still.Sticking with Chrome&#x2F;Chromium is a bit of a form of Stockholm syndrome. People keep convincing themselves it isn&#x27;t that bad and that the ads are fine and not that intrusive and that Google means well. Etc.Firefox is technically independent; not financially. It and Safari are the only non Chromium based browsers left in addition to a small number of early stage attempts to implement a browser that don&#x27;t look like they are going to be a credible alternative any time soon. Google is paying both Apple and Mozilla to be the default search engine in their browser. And unlike Mozilla, Apple isn&#x27;t exactly dependent on charity and also getting a lot more from Google than Mozilla because they have hundreds of millions of iphone users. Browser real estate is valuable; especially on mobile.But we live in a weird world where we are dependent on a single company financing the development of essentially all browsers that are commonly used through advertising. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly healthy and especially the Apple deal smells like a classic anti competitive move that ought to trigger some legal action. It would be nice to see the search and browser markets open up a bit. Especially on mobile. Especially on IOS where Apple enforces a Safari monopoly. Every other browser has to use the Safari rendering engine. reply bad_user 21 minutes agoparentBoth Firefox and Safari are essentially funded by Google&#x27;s ads. People think of Safari as independent, but the billions that Apple receives from Google every year are enough to fully fund it and to make a good profit.This has implications. For one, neither of them can go after Google&#x27;s cash cows without losing their main revenue source.Microsoft&#x27;s Edge is leeching off Google&#x27;s work, but gets funded by Bing&#x27;s Ads. They can&#x27;t go after Google&#x27;s cash cows without endangering their operation.The open secret is that the development of all browsers is from advertising, and most of that is from Google&#x27;s ads.

Although Firefox wasn&#x27;t the only app that crashed and this wasn&#x27;t a Firefox specific issue. reply ruszki 40 minutes agorootparentToo small RAM should never be an issue (except in very extreme cases, like a given data cannot fit in RAM at all, or there is no swap), especially not when another app uses it. It should just slow things down, because data transfer between swap and memory. reply dale_glass 1 hour agorootparentprevDefinitely not RAM.

And for the Google stock to go up people have to use Android without a firewall, Chrome browser in all their devices, Gmail, and so on.. so they be tracked, their data to be harvested and sold x10000 so that the ad machine makes billions and the stock price goes up.I decided to STOP pestering my friends on switching to Signal, Firefox, etc. and instead I just bought stocks of Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc.. Since people don&#x27;t want to protect their own privacy and the one of their children, and I cannot help them.. well then I can help myself.I will &#x27;forever&#x27; use FF and suggest it ONCE to friends and family, and then move on with my life (on the &#x27;consulting friends & family on privacy focused solutions).EDIT: Unfortunately I am not joking on the above.. it made me throw up a bit in my mouth the first time I sat down and bought Google and Meta stock (I was a mutual funds guy until then). I use \"dollar cost averaging\" so I buy a little, but very often (monthly). I got tired of debating with people on why THEIR privacy is CRITICAL for them and their children. Insurance companies will screw them in the future, Pedophiles are monitoring their instagram, Google (and everyone they sell the data to) knowing where they keep and spend their money, Google knowing who they email and what&#x2F;when&#x2F;why&#x2F;etc. It is insane what type and how much data &#x27;we&#x27; are freely giving away, only to bite us in the a$$.

The only way of it looking less ugly is to do some unofficial tweaks which break from version to version. I was a Firefox user for years until they&#x27;ve changed the UI, and now I can&#x27;t go back because of how it LOOKS.Also, the Mozilla ideology. Why can&#x27;t the browser be just a piece of software and that&#x27;s it?I just use Vivaldi.Edit: I can sense that Firefox zealotry is strong in this topic. People who downvote: you don&#x27;t accept that someone has a different aesthetics than you, or what&#x27;s the reason? That just reinforces my choice to stay away, people who Mozilla attracts are not really on the same wavelength as me I guess. reply MattPalmer1086 1 hour agoparentFunny, I use Firefox and think Chrome looks a bit uglier.

E.g. Chrome will not wait for content blockers to initialize before sending out requests, so the first website that opens when you start Chrome is probably not content blocked.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uBlock&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;uBlock-Origin-works-b... reply charcircuit 43 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure this is fixed with the new API for blocking network requests MV3 added. This list of rules is persisted between browser sessions. reply INTPenis 1 hour agoparentprevCan you elaborate? Firefox had extensions before Chrome existed. Firefox has always been the most versatile and secure way to browse the web. The only reason Chrome is even in the discussion is because Google abused its monopoly to push it on people. And yes a lot of people will say it&#x27;s faster, all that speed lead you straight into the claws of Google doing whatever they want with you. reply ekianjo 1 hour agorootparentFirefox has dropped its own extensions to follow Chromes extension model for a long time now reply nicman23 37 minutes agorootparentthe issue was more of a security &#x2F; architecture than just following chrome. xul needed to change and webextensions was already open and tested.that said, i still miss a couple of xul extensions reply rfoo 1 hour agorootparentprev> Firefox has always been the most versatile and secure way to browse the web.Currently, a Chrome full-chain is notably harder than a Firefox full-chain, with the former being at \"state actor ITW\" level, and the latter being at \"your friends started a never-heard of consultancy and they decided to do the classical trick - pwning Firefox at Pwn2Own\" level. reply INTPenis 1 hour agorootparentYeah but if Google keeps removing the ability to block content then Firefox will be more secure simply by filtering dynamic content from unknown domains. Drive by attacks are the most common way to spread malware, this is exactly what extensions like noscript prevent.This isn&#x27;t the first time Chrome has crippled user ability to filter content on a deep level.So it doesn&#x27;t matter how much hardening Chrome has if it allows for drive by download attacks from unknown domains. reply broodbucket 41 minutes agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think these are especially relevant to the threat models of average users. Security for most people means not getting malware from random sites and not having all their data given away, and noone is blowing an 0day sandbox escape on an average internet user.Adblocking extensions go a very long way in terms of keeping average users safe. If you&#x27;re a potential target of sophisticated actors (of any level of sophistication above script kiddie) then you&#x27;re not really the target audience of generic browser advice. reply Svip 1 hour agoparentprevFirefox is also supporting Manifest V3, like Chrome, but Firefox is not removing support for Manifest V2, unlike Chrome. reply gman83 1 hour agoparentprevThey&#x27;re not making Manifest V3 mandatory.

    "originBody": "~ $ uname Linux ~ $ darling shell Darling [~]$ uname Darwin Darling Darling is a translation layer that lets you run macOS software on Linux Fast Darling runs macOS software directly without using a hardware emulator. Free Like Linux, Darling is free and open-source software. It is developed openly on GitHub and distributed under the GNU GPL license version 3. Compatible Darling implements a complete Darwin environment. Mach, dyld, launchd — everything you'd expect. Easy to use Darling does most of the setup for you. Sit back and enjoy using your favorite software. Native We aim to fully integrate apps running under Darling into the Linux desktop experience by making them look, feel and behave just like native Linux apps. That sounds a lot like Wine And it is! Wine lets you run Windows software on Linux, and Darling does the same for macOS software. Another similar project is Anbox, for Android apps. Does it support GUI apps? Almost! This took us a lot of time and effort, but we finally have basic experimental support for running simple graphical applications. Does it violate Apple's EULA? No! We only directly use those parts of Darwin that are released as fully free software. Does the name Darling mean anything? The name Darling is a combination of “Darwin” and “Linux”. Darwin is the core operating system macOS and iOS are based on. Can I run Darling on Windows using WSL? With WSL 2, yes! See the documentation for more details. Do you know about opensource.apple.com, GNUstep, The Cocotron and other projects? We do, and in fact, Darling is largely based on the original Darwin source code published by Apple. We use The Cocotron as a basis for our Cocoa implementation, along with the Apportable Foundation and various bits of GNUstep. Do you have plans for supporting iOS apps? Yes, in the long run, we'd like to be able to run iOS apps on ARM devices (like most Android phones). A significant challenge here would be to write our own implementation of UIKit. Come talk to us if you're interested in working on this! How do I contribute? Start by reading the documentation and our blog to get familiar with Darling internals. Then, come and join us on GitHub. It's great if you have experience in developing for macOS or iOS, but it's absolutely not required to start contributing.",

Access to reminders, notes, in theory messages (I don&#x27;t use it so can&#x27;t vouch for it).The thing to do is to use Chrome (yes...), and open the page. In the hamburger, go to \"Create a Desktop shortcut\". Choose \"open in a new window\". This gives you a desktop shortcut to open the page in a standalone way. Visible to your launcher, distinct ctrl+tab... it&#x27;s janky but I&#x27;ve found this works well.Firefox please add the Chrome standalone desktop shortcut feature! reply smasher164 7 hours agorootparentYeah, I also tend to bring up iCloud Notes in a browser tab.

The GCC project has had a couple of notable periods of stagnation, in each case being \"rescued\" by the emergence of meaningful competition. First EGCS, and then later llvm.Clang brought new developers to the space, it disproved the assertion that error messages had to be cryptic and unhelpful, and it has been a peer competitor for an extended period of time now.

Just curious if anyone knows.. thaumaturgy 12 hours agoThe end result was a stalemate. Reddit did not change any of its policies. Enough of the people responsible for posting and managing content left the platform to cause a noticeable impact on it.Here&#x27;s a fun thing to look at, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subredditstats.com&#x2F; for any major subreddit, e.g.:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subredditstats.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;worldnewshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;subredditstats.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;explainlikeimfivehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;subredditstats.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;videosAll of the most popular subreddits show a steady decline from 2019 to present, with a sharp drop in July 2023. Once this happens to a platform, it&#x27;s rare for the platform to ever get those users back at scale. It&#x27;s safe money that Reddit will now be a zombie platform, a la Slashdot -- still up and running with some users, but with flat or declining activity forever. reply arp242 11 hours agoparentThat data seems wrong. I don&#x27;t use Reddit much, but I checked the data aginast some smaller subs I sometimes check, and according to those charts they have just a few comments per day, but I know for a fact that&#x27;s wrong.It&#x27;s wrong for all subs I checked. For example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subredditstats.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;thethickofitJust 3 comments for Nov 22, 8 for Nov 23. But how does that square with the existence of this thread from Nob 22 with 84 comments? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;thethickofit&#x2F;comments&#x2F;181d68u&#x2F;ben_s...And there&#x27;s a bunch of other threads too! It&#x27;s not just \"a little bit wrong\" it&#x27;s completely wrong. That site seems about on the ball as a dead seal. reply kmlevitt 10 hours agorootparentI still have mod status on a large-ish (70k+) subreddit so I can view reddit&#x27;s internal traffic statistics for it, and these estimates are definitely wrong.These stats claim the sub has had 10-20 comments per day in just the past month, so maybe 300-600 tops.In reality it&#x27;s had 1200+ comments just in the past week alone and probably closer to 5000 for the month. And you can see the activity with your own eyes in every thread, so I definitely trust reddit&#x27;s own stats more. reply srcreigh 8 hours agorootparentis your sub growing? reply kmlevitt 6 hours agorootparentYes, still. I’m a mod on a few other decent sized subs (30k-ish) actually and most of them are still growing, unless the topic at hand is clearly outdated. reply johnnyanmac 3 hours agorootparentReddit throttled its API usage a month before the great 3rd party purge, so I&#x27;m guessing whatever collection method that site was using simply doesn&#x27;t work correctly anymore. Or worse yet, the remnants of the API spits out completely incorrect data itself.Sounds like Reddit itself has recovered in terms of raw numbers, but I (and others) have noticed yet another downtick in quality. Lot more bots (AI craze doesn&#x27;t help. And despite the API narrative being used to counter them, they probably suferent the least), comments seem to be as hostile as early pandemic. But these are hard to measure objectively. reply kmlevitt 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m on reddit a lot less these days, but subjectively it seems about the same for me, except most of the old subreddits I&#x27;m a legacy mod on are way busier than I remember. They&#x27;re definitely still gaining users.It could just be that the longer you&#x27;re on there, the worse the quality appears to get to you as newcomers come. People always start to feel that way after being there some time. But then again people have been complaining about the quality of reddit going down literally almost as long as reddit has existed. reply mnky9800n 3 hours agorootparentIn my opinion Reddit has a content problem in the same way 24 hour news does. Simply put, there&#x27;s not enough content to put up constantly so it&#x27;s supplemented with repeating memes, reposts, and drama. reply kmlevitt 2 hours agorootparentAt the end of the day it comes down to the upvotes, though. If the other users are on your wavelength, you’ll probably like whatever they recommend. But over time you could have less in common with the average user there, meaning what they upvote will be less relevant to you too. replylittlestymaar 2 hours agorootparentprevIn practice subs are always growing while there&#x27;s activity on it, because barely anyone ever leaves a subreddit. reply kmlevitt 1 hour agorootparentThis is true. But we are also up in terms of page views per month, unique visitors, etc., etc. reddit has probably been getting gradually bigger each year for as long as I can remember, and it doesn’t look like that trend has peaked off yet. At least not the subs I have access to. reply echelon 7 hours agorootparentprevDid you participate in the blackout? What was your impression of it? Were any of the tools you used impacted by the API ban?I think a much more effective strategy would be a user-led LLM \"spamming\" campaign.Package up a lightweight, easy to use LLM for Windows users and let them turn their accounts into noise. Purposely generate overly-argumentative, blatantly wrong prose on every subject and in every subreddit.Reddit would hate that. Just a hundred users engaging in it could probably tank the quality of the whole site. reply kmlevitt 6 hours agorootparentI don’t go on Reddit that much anymore and I haven’t been active as a mod on that sub for a very long time. But based on my experience doing it, users are quite good at identifying stupid bullshit and reporting it to mods, which makes it easy to spot. Plus they downvote low quality comments like crazy so it gets buried and people don’t even see it.Because of those things Prank spammers usually don’t last long. Usually a small gang of people will try something like that and you can quickly ban them. They might try to come back on new accounts but eventually tire of it and find another way to keep themselves busy. The mod queue feature is quite efficient so we can ban reported junk much faster than they can post.I’m not saying it couldn’t happen, but it would be more difficult than you might think. If you try to automated completely it would cost you an awful lot in fees (Open AI’s server bills are “eye-watering“ and if you go past the free limit they start passing that cost onto you), and the admin’s would probably be able to identify the accounts doing it and ban them site wide. reply rglullis 6 hours agorootparentprevWhile an interesting idea, the problem is that the majority of users would be more bothered by it and they simply don&#x27;t care enough about Reddit&#x27;s management to fight it. reply thaumaturgy 10 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38425056https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38425415You should probably also point out the big red text on the subredditstats pages. I didn&#x27;t see it when I posted the links, since I&#x27;m colorblind and hues of red are entirely invisible to me. Also I have trouble counting past the number of fingers on my hands, so I didn&#x27;t notice that the numbers were a bit off.

What an odd comment. reply thaumaturgy 9 hours agorootparentA little bit of snark, not directed at you specifically. Several people now have pointed out either the red text at top, or that the numbers aren&#x27;t an exact match, or both, without themselves bothering to read through this thread to see if those had already been discussed. reply arp242 7 hours agorootparentIIRC there was just one comment when I posted that (but others may have been posted in the 10 or 15 minutes it took me to write that), and I still feel my comment adds value, because \"likely to be wrong\" in the warning seems like a rather weak phrasing (can also mean it&#x27;s correct!), as are some of the other \"I think this may be wrong\" comments I see here.I also suspect that smaller subs are a more useful measure than these huge subs, because I&#x27;d expect them to die off much quicker than the huge ones with a lot of inertia.That said, I understand it can be annoying having 16 people tell you you&#x27;re wrong all in slightly different ways. It&#x27;s the price of posting on the internet I&#x27;m afraid. But it was (and still is!) the top post on this thread, even though it&#x27;s not just factually wrong, but spectacularly factually wrong – which is fine, everyone is wrong sometimes – but people do have the tendency to point that out. As long as it&#x27;s not a pedantic point I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s wrong even if there&#x27;s a comment already, if you think you can make that point better. reply thaumaturgy 5 hours agorootparentSo, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong in a way that matters for this discussion.The data is useless as an absolute measure of activity, sure, as described in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38425501. The message at the top of the main subredditstats page says, \"...the data collector is not robust, and so the numbers should only be used as a general guide.\" You can read that. Let&#x27;s assume I can read that, too.But it does track as a representative sample of trends. Picking something less noisy than a niche sub, we can ask whether there have been recent newsworthy events that might show up as spikes in this data. And, there is: look again at the posts&#x2F;day and comments&#x2F;day graphs on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subredditstats.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;worldnews, and you see clear spikes in activity right around October 7 -- well after Reddit&#x27;s API changes would have affected subredditstats.If the data collector has only been able to pick up, say, approximately 20% of the site&#x27;s activity for each subreddit, then trends are still trends as long as the data collection hasn&#x27;t changed in a radically new way. And, sure, that could be the case after Reddit&#x27;s API changes, but as I pointed out in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38425150 (and as supported in another user&#x27;s reply using an entirely different source of data), the API changes don&#x27;t line up precisely with the change in user activity, and Reddit is clearly, observably, less active now in all of its large subs.Now, for my part, I assumed this would all be pretty obvious stuff. I&#x27;m not doing a terribly deep analysis here; I&#x27;d expect anyone else to see the same things at a glance. But a few people seem to think that because the numbers aren&#x27;t a perfect match, the entire point just collapses and clearly Reddit is now busier than ever, and those people are completely missing the point. Using a 12,000-subscriber sub with the noisiest possible data to try to disprove sitewide trends is even more wrong, and then smugly saying, \"everyone is wrong sometimes\", is not just condescending, but frankly embarrassing.The diametrically opposing argument here is that Reddit is perfectly healthy and the API changes and blackout protest had no significant impact on the site, and that checks notes 12,000 subscribers in r&#x2F;thethickofit are sufficient evidence for this. And, like, okay, if that&#x27;s your argument, cool, carry on, just come out and say so. replymschuster91 7 hours agorootparentprevFor what it&#x27;s worth: many of the NSFW subreddits are dead. Even r&#x2F;gonewild, one of the OGs - either they&#x27;ve gotten closed due to being unmoderated or they&#x27;ve been overrun by onlyfxns spam, or they&#x27;ve been hit by some weird downranking like GW.Particularly the nsfw loss hits hard for those interested in niche communities. We&#x27;ve lost tumblr, never had any of the Meta (FB, Instagram) views, Reddit is holding on on threads, Pornhub went down in flames following their outright incompetence, and Twitter has gotten a hellscape from EM&#x27;s hopeless attempts to keep the spammers away (and his other antics). reply arp242 6 hours agorootparent> overrun by onlyfxns spamI suspect this is the bigger issue to be honest. I certainly stopped because of this. Not that I begrudge people having OF or advertising that, but please, for fuck&#x27;s sake, stay on-topic, and don&#x27;t spam the fuck out of things with content barely related to the sub&#x27;s topic.I also really hate the shift in language to be more personal; e.g. \"would you like to [..]\" &#x2F; \"I would like YOU to [..]\" and stuff like that. It&#x27;s just creepy and manipulative.

This isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s easy to mindlessly spam LLM-spam at.

Certainly not Reddit. reply valianteffort 10 hours agorootparentprevOne of my favorite conspiracies is that reddit is mostly just LLM&#x27;s and paid agents talking to eachother.

More recently, after the blackout and user exodus, &#x2F;r&#x2F;de noticed a bunch of new German-language copies of popular English-language subs being created with a bunch of autotranslated comments[1]. So Reddit&#x27;s administration is not above creating fake accounts and content to juice numbers.How much of Reddit&#x27;s engagement is faked is up for debate - I suspect it&#x27;s less than we think.

Some posters aren’t anonymous at all, because they also have linked YouTube or Instagram accounts that use their real name and face.

In fact growth as if been seen at normal rates, as if nothing happened. reply lopis 1 hour agoparentprev> It&#x27;s safe money that Reddit will now be a zombie platformThat&#x27;s just not the reality. I&#x27;m surprised and pleased to see that big subreddits suffered a significant decline, but I notice the number of subscribers continues to grow. Also, after the the dust settled, Lemmy activity really took a downturn. Small communities just can&#x27;t survive the migration en masse. Whenever I need to look up something I still eventually need to check reddit, and most communities seem alive and healthy... The truth is, major subreddits are not what keeps reddit alive. reply n2d4 12 hours agoparentprevThis is just straight misinformation. If you go on any of the \"big subs\" you linked, you&#x27;ll see that there are far more comments than that per day. For example, in ELI5, by just taking the 5 most commented posts that were posted in the last 24h, they have 700 comments which is more than the peak that Subreddit Stats says they had since July.Instead, if you go on Subreddit Stats and read the text with the big red font, you&#x27;ll see the explanation why the API changes have made such a difference:> Heads up!

If you can, it&#x27;s probably worth leaving Reddit for other platforms - especially open-source&#x2F;federated ones like Lemmy.My assumption is the maintainer just hasn&#x27;t edited their scraper at all, and it&#x27;s now running into lots of rate limiting and missing most new comments and posts.

Personally I used to visit Reddit multiple times per day but now I typically visit it once or twice per week, if at all. I&#x27;m sure the official app is fine, but the approach they took to third party developers soured it for me.Ultimately I think if anything had any impact on Reddit&#x27;s traffic it would have been the killing of the defacto mobile apps. The lesson any future founders should take is to kill off third party apps sooner rather than later if you ever want to do so, before user growth on those platforms becomes an issue. reply pcdandy 1 hour agorootparentReddit Is Fun (rif) was a well-designed app that just worked. It was fast, had a customisable user interface with defaults that didn&#x27;t get in the way of enjoying the content, and could run on all of my devices easily, including an Android 7 phone from 2018. It&#x27;s a shining examplar of what a mobile browsing app should be like.By comparison, the official Reddit app feels somewhat slower, even on my relatively new Android 12 phone from 2021, having a very noticeable lag when scrolling through articles and comments. For video and photo posts, there&#x27;s no way of browsing the comments without clicking on the thumbnail and having it auto-play the videos every time, meaning I need to react fast to pause the video (there is practically no way of stopping this). And it doesn&#x27;t support Android 7 anymore, meaning the only way to access it from my 2018 phone is via the browser.It baffles me why Reddit would want to cut support for 3rd party apps when they were a key component in the Reddit ecosystem. reply akaij 10 hours agoparentprevApollo still works perfectly if you sideload it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;apolloapp&#x2F;comments&#x2F;14nzii3&#x2F;how_to_c...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ichitaso&#x2F;ApolloPatcher&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latesthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EthanArbuckle&#x2F;Apollo-CustomApiCredentials reply wkat4242 6 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s so great about Apollo I wonder?

No matter how proficient people claim to be with a phone keyboard, it is a medium that discourages longform text. The blackout made no difference with regard to that, the damage was already done.Post quality also declined after the 2017 redesign. The old design had a sidebar where subreddits kept a FAQ and wiki. Today, the same questions get asked again and again on many subreddits. Mods can&#x27;t lock those posts and direct the author to the FAQ, because most users can&#x27;t even see the FAQ. Mods who try to ensure a firm hand regularly get excoriated by the community, even by regulars on the sub, as \"gatekeepers\". reply bobsmooth 7 hours agorootparentThe concept of \"gatekeeping\" has ruined online communities.

Top commenters are still top commenters and guide the conversations with authority. They are still in most threads with the most upvotes.Communities are defined by the content contributors first and for most. That&#x27;s something Reddit forgot.Reddit started with a little bit of modding to clean up the mess which is always needed (how it works on HN). Then every year it seemed to grow and grow, mods were now self-annoited editors of their own pet magazines. A hundred plus mods were added to major subs, where in some 50% of comments can get removed in major threads. r&#x2F;science has many many threads where 75% of comments were removed, almost entirely as they didn&#x27;t fit some idea of what should be discussed, what was acceptable.That&#x27;s a big difference from RTFM culture on forums. reply OfSanguineFire 2 hours agorootparentNo, people don&#x27;t backlash against just \"excessive modding\". I have witnessed on several subs a belief that mods should never be able to lock a post of a question that comes up several times a week. The thinking goes, for example, that a person posting a discussed-to-death question isn&#x27;t just looking for an answer to the question, but rather he&#x2F;she is trying to socialize and feel part of a community. Therefore, mods who lock such posts are cruelly denying a person an outlet for socializing.You write about developments on major subs, but those are just that, the major subs. Niche hobby subs, on the other hand, often don&#x27;t see the level of moderation they actually need in order to retain knowledgeable contributors. People with a certain level of proficiency in a hobby will bail if the discussion is predominantly newbie questions or repetitive arguments. reply davesmylie 12 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know about \"only garbage gets posted\".In one of the craft based subs I moderate (5m subs - reasonably sized one), it&#x27;s not so much the quality of posts has dropped, it&#x27;s that the quantity has dropped, and dropped significantly. This seems to directly translate to garbage posts getting a lot more visibility and sticking around for a lot longer. The good quality posts are still there, but proportionally the garbage is much more visible now.This is enough of a problem that subscribers have been complaining about it. Not much can be done until (and only if) the number of actual contributors begins to rise again.On the other hand, I also run a tiny local city sub (maybe 20k ppl) - the number of posts has been steadily growing. I can&#x27;t work that one out. reply jwells89 10 hours agorootparentThat drop in quantity in hobby subs tracks pretty well with the theory that was getting tossed around a few months ago that the most frequent posters and power users disproportionally used third party apps while users of the official app had more of a tendency to be only very casual posters or just lurkers.Local subs growing despite power users vacating kind of lines up with this too — casual users seem more likely to treat Reddit like one of the bigger platforms like Facebook, seeking out subreddits that are more broadly appealing or based around locality rather than interest-based subreddits. reply veqq 12 hours agorootparentprev> the quantity has dropped, and dropped significantlyMine&#x27;s gone from 1-1.5k to 2-400 posts a day. reply davesmylie 12 hours agorootparentI suspect over time the numbers will grow back to where they were.... but it&#x27;s gonna be a completely different crowd that what made it great originally.reddit wants to jump on to the low-effort click-drawing content bandwagon - whilst good for their numbers in short term I think low term it&#x27;s not going to be great.

I&#x27;ve spoken with friends at Reddit who tell me that overall post volume is basically back up to normal, but my participation was mostly in smaller subs. Some of them got killed for lack of moderators, some are basically dead because people left and didn&#x27;t come back, and a couple that are at similar levels of traffic seem to have had a lot of the good posters leave and be replaced by a bunch of shitposters, self promotion, and bots.

If your community is text based, Lemmy is likely a good fit.Picture based communities have a NSFW &#x2F; trolling problem that is still an open question. If trolls can post CSAM to threaten the moderators &#x2F; admins, what are Lemmy admins supposed to do about that?DeFederation (and temporary DeFederation) are okay tools for this problem... But better tools need to be built into Lemmy. Random server #244 doesn&#x27;t necessarily deserve to be defederated if just 20 or so trolls are posting CSAM and threatening Admins. Nominally, a tool that more selectively bans users (or new users only) instead of cutting off the whole server would be ideal. reply thesuperbigfrog 16 hours agoprevSome Reddit communities fled to other platforms such as Lemmy: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lemmy_(social_network)Many subreddit moderators protested in various ways and were removed and replaced.Reddit never agreed or compromised and for the most part the movement seems to have run out of steam.Maybe if Reddit squeezes more, more users will go to Lemmy and similar alternative platforms? reply shitlord 2 hours agoparentLemmy.world has 143k users. For comparison, a now-banned snuff film subreddit made their own website, and it has over 1M users. Lemmy and similar platforms just aren&#x27;t very appealing to the hordes of people who left reddit. Those users are getting their dopamine fix from somewhere else. reply x86x87 15 hours agoparentprevNah. A lot of power users are gone. Now it will slowly slide into irrelevance. reply punkspider 12 hours agorootparentReddit&#x27;s Google traffic is growing at this time. The only time it was higher was in March 2022, according to SEMrush.This is because Google is assigning more weight to user-generated content, since the rise of AI-generated content, and I believe traffic will keep growing. reply jseliger 14 hours agorootparentprevWe&#x27;ll see. Back in 2015 I wrote about how poor moderation and moderator incentives were problems, and yet since then Reddit has kept growing: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jakeseliger.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;the-moderator-problem-how.... reply marginalia_nu 14 hours agorootparentYou can be both large and irrelevant. Facebook is perhaps the best example of this. Reddit feels headed in the same direction. reply ecshafer 8 hours agorootparentFacebook is incredibly relevant. It probably has more impact on more people&#x27;s lives than Twitter or Reddit. Facebook isn&#x27;t cool anymore. But for the 30+ crowd, especially the non-college educated crowd its huge. Tons of small businesses use it to host their \"websites\", the community groups are huge, parents &#x2F; family groups, facebook marketplace totally replaced craigslist for a lot of people. reply smrtinsert 12 hours agorootparentprevDefine irrelevant, because if it has eyeballs... reply david927 12 hours agorootparentIf early adopters have moved elsewhere, and it&#x27;s all late-majority, it will have the most eyeballs right before it dies out. reply x86x87 12 hours agorootparentprevFacebook has the eyeballs.

Facebook is highly relevant. replypowera 14 hours agorootparentprevMany of the \"power users\" were outright liabilities for Reddit, and they should consider their departure a good thing. reply x86x87 14 hours agorootparentIt depends. When your best content and the filtering of crap content comes from these power users you&#x27;re in trouble when they leave. reply realusername 14 hours agorootparentprevI disagree, they had a lot power users creating the content and now it definitely dropped in quality. reply treyd 10 hours agoparentprevI wrote an article [1] back in June about Lemmy and how reddit communities leaving should approach it but it seems like in practice it&#x27;s been a lot more unstructured than I thought it should have been. Most users&#x2F;boards are on lemmy.world. That&#x27;s probably fine though, there are still some more niche boards. I just wish there was a better automatic cross-posting between parallel boards.Personally I have essentially not used reddit since June outside of following links there from searches. It was the thing that got me to make an HN account after being a passive reader for like 7 years.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tr3y.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;tech&#x2F;reddit.html reply MegaDeKay 6 hours agoparentprevSpeaking of \"other platforms\", I know of a 3D printing sub that went over to Discord and they have no plans to ever go back. I wonder how many other subs headed over to Discord as well. reply crtified 9 hours agoprevAs a casual but persistent user, it pains me to say it - because ethically I support the grassroots side of the equation - but as a path of least resistance to casual, anonymous public engagement on a wide range of topics, there seems no viable alternative. [For a given subjective value of &#x27;viable&#x27;, naturally!]. So after a period of abstention, I gradually ended up back there, simply because I know of no other sizeable gatherings on certain topics that aren&#x27;t either annoyingly gatekept (technically, and&#x2F;or socially), and&#x2F;or are far more toxic themselves.Look at HN - simple hierarchical discussion forums with a negligible barrier to entry and no grating artificial limitations, and we quite rightly love it.In short, I still use Reddit, but there&#x27;s nothing ideological about that choice. reply rexf 2 hours agoparentagreed. The loss of Apollo was a huge blow to the UX since the official Reddit app is hard to use and has poor design choices (in favor of business choices). Why would the official app have TINY up and down vote buttons? There are countless baffling decisions in the design & functionality in the official app.Without an alternative to reddit, using the reddit app remains the way to stay informed & engaged in various niche reddit communities. reply denysvitali 11 hours agoprevI think people silently left, and now Reddit usage declined. I don&#x27;t have the data to prove it - but from the quality of the content nowadays (for the little I have checked it out) is really bad.I personally tried to build an alternative back then [1] (open source [2]), but the problem even Reddit is facing now is acquiring more users and keeping high quality content.Last time I checked Lemmy, it wasn&#x27;t doing good either - but these might just be personal Interpretations of the current situation.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rings.social&#x2F;[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rings-social reply fibonachos 8 hours agoparentI&#x27;m one of those who simply left, though I don&#x27;t know that deleting my account counts as \"silently\". My usage had already been on the decline at that point, so I just needed that last push to leave for good. reply DoreenMichele 8 hours agoprevReddit has a right and a need to figure out monetization. This was part of that effort and it was likely painful but Reddit is dead anyway if it never figures out monetization.I didn&#x27;t participate in the blackout. I felt the mods were wrong to take that approach.I did go to bat for blind mods. They need better mod tools than they have.That comment is here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36232441Hopefully Reddit does figure out how to both foster attractive communities and make enough money.I run a bunch of Reddits. One has 20k members and says \"top 5 percent\" and many have a few hundred and say \"top 50 percent.\" There&#x27;s a lot more to Reddit than the very big Reddits.I think the relatively small number of very big Reddits get too much press. That&#x27;s not all there is to Reddit and I hope they defy the expectations of people already pronouncing them \"dead.\" reply tensor 8 hours agoparentThey have a right yes, but they will also rightly suffer from their approach. I not only participated in the blackout, but because of the CEOs arrogant comments about how valuable my data is and how they deserve to sell it, while destroying the tools I value and use, I also deleted all of my valuable data from reddit and after handing off the one sub I moderated I left the platform forever.I think reddit is a wonderful idea that needs different leadership, and the only way for that to happen at this point is for reddit to die and something new and preferably harder to buy out takes its place. reply DoreenMichele 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m a blogger and freelance writer. I&#x27;ve spent years saying that programmers make good money, then expect slave labor from writers and content developers.If the only way people will \"allow\" a valuable service to live is as their bitch, the entire internet is welcome to go die in a fire while we dream up some new answer for the future of this world. reply JumpCrisscross 6 hours agorootparent> blogger and freelance writerReddit’s writers and content producers, i.e. users, are still unpaid. They’re just also being used to train LLMs aimed at reducing the number of independent bloggers and writers. reply intended 6 hours agorootparentprevIn that case Reddit should die.Reddit’s decision changed it previous equation with mods, and redefined the limits of power.Reddit, since inception, had never made specific hire fire decisions for mods, especially for purely monetary reasons.This makes it less volunteer moderation, and purely unpaid labor.NB: I would add return on investment to your cabinet of villains. reply DoreenMichele 6 hours agorootparentReddit allows me to establish a community for free. I&#x27;ve established a number of them.If people don&#x27;t want to be unpaid mods, they don&#x27;t have to be. No one forced them into that.Do we need to address some things? Sure. But I have long advocated for the right of people to engage in unpaid labor or low paid labor if they choose to.It&#x27;s exactly how Founders of startups create the company that makes them millionaires. Saying no one is allowed to without first being rich creates a permanent social divide.Would I like for there to be a means to get paid for moderating on reddit? Maybe. I certainly could use more money.Do I want the burdens that typically accompany a paid day job? No. I&#x27;m handicapped and that&#x27;s a disaster waiting to happen.A lot of this was not intentional.

Their revenue was skyrocketing over the last couple years before they decided to ruin the API. reply DoreenMichele 7 hours agorootparentWikipedia indicates it&#x27;s still a private company. My recollection is they are failing to hit figures that would make for an attractive buy out or IPO. reply opportune 6 hours agorootparentThey grew their employee count massively (400->2000) as their revenue grew over the past few years though. Part of that is, yeah, you have to spend money to make money. But I know for a fact not all of those employees were doing ad sales or direct monetization.You can speculate as to why they hired so many people: pandemic tech hiring FOMO, looking more attractive to investors, empire building, not being willing to settle for a paltry 10-figure valuation and so trying to build out to hit 11-figures. But they don&#x27;t need that many people and they could easily become profitable by doing a big layoff (just as money software companies could). At this point it&#x27;s not a question of survival or existence for them, nor of IPO readiness, so much as it is IPO optimization. reply DoreenMichele 6 hours agorootparentYeah, just fire most of the staff. It worked so well for Twitter.I don&#x27;t know the details. I didn&#x27;t follow it that closely. I don&#x27;t care that much.I&#x27;ve read that the business decision that sparked the blackout had something to do with trying to make money. They&#x27;re a business, not a charity.There&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch. People want endless amounts of free shit. The people who don&#x27;t want reddit unless it&#x27;s both free and takes their orders are people I don&#x27;t personally sympathize with.I don&#x27;t really expect to argue this further. I&#x27;ve already argued it way more than I really care to. reply Dylan16807 7 hours agorootparentprevIf profitability isn&#x27;t enough for them, I have no sympathy.And beyond that, how fast do they expect to grow after this many years? Be happy with a good thing! Their growth rate was very impressive! reply dclowd9901 8 hours agoparentprevSince you run a few subs maybe you know: if modding has gotten harder since the API switch, why don’t mods just bring in more mods to help? reply redserk 6 hours agorootparentNot the person you’re responding to, but team coordination is a very difficult task as you add people.It’s difficult enough getting 8 developers on the exact same page when writing code, now imagine trying to moderate to a ruleset with a much greater degree of ambiguity. reply DoreenMichele 8 hours agorootparentprevI work alone. I accepted the offer to join me on my largest forum once. They bailed within a day or three without so much as saying \"bye, bitch!\"I&#x27;m not blind. I have no idea if it&#x27;s gotten harder for blind mods.Sorry. reply INTPenis 12 hours agoprevNothing, some of us already knew nothing would come of it. People are just so dramatic and they don&#x27;t understand the services they&#x27;re using.Most people have no idea what&#x27;s behind reddit, facebook, youtube. They just see a free shiny thing and start using it. Then one day the free shiny thing has a gross ad on it, and one day it has another one, and before they know it, it&#x27;s unusable. reply Projectiboga 14 hours agoprevIt pushed me over to here more. I used to lurk on both HN, Reddit and some tech sites on a web 2.0 aggregator ( www.jimmyr.com ) ever since Digg was still going strong. I used to follow r&#x2F;science, r&#x2F;ech, r&#x2F;pics or r&#x2F;images (basically imgur top list) and the front page, all in separate dozen item lists, each in a separate tabbed section. Front had digg on onther tab, science w newscientist etc. The front page on there which lagged the main front page slightly as it was from some cache had slowly been eroding over the years but now what I see there is a ghost of its self. I&#x27;ll wander over to R&#x2F;usenet now to check the holiday deals and see what that forum looks like now. reply csomar 6 hours agoprevI left. Came back and now left again. There isn’t a readily available alternative at the moment. However, the quality has declined so much that it has become garbage. The discussion seems to be driven by bots, mercenaries and AI.I also think many reddit users moved to HN which resulted in some quality going down as they bring the old reddit culture with them, but I’m betting that won’t last.I think it’s still early to tell. Reddit still has lots of traction and even if it’s becoming less attractive, the alternative is not quite there yet. reply w-m 11 hours agoprevAnother data point, the top AskReddit posts of the past year [0].Zero of the top 25 posts of the last twelve months are younger than five months.

I am surprised I remember that much :) replyfdgjgbdfhgb 15 hours agoprevAnecdotally, I mostly stopped using it, except for sport news and live threads.The subreddit I moderate (100k subs) saw no lasting impact on traffic. We participated in the blackout for 2 or 3 days and then carried on as normal.To be fair, it is a sub for a TV show, so the traffic is very seasonal. The blackout happened in the off-season, and now that the show is back we have a lot of traffic again. reply Havoc 8 hours agoprevNothing. They correctly surmised that there are enough people that don’t care and won’t notice the drop in quality.Then again Reddit is doing all it can to make the site as UX hostile as possible so I guess their network effects are powerful reply broodbucket 8 hours agoparentI think it&#x27;s more than nothing, though app monetisation may still be enough to justify the loss. The vast majority of users do not contribute content and they certainly don&#x27;t help moderate communities - a lot of the content that is good on reddit either comes directly from or is facilitated by the people who care a lot, and those people are the most impacted by third party apps going away, old reddit being abandoned, moderation tools being weakened, new reddit obsoleting per-subreddit CSS, etc.reddit was the place for a lot of communities (and for the most part still is) but there&#x27;s a lot of places on the internet you can get generic mass-market content, that might be what drives reddit&#x27;s bottom line but it&#x27;s not what makes it special. The masses will go to the next popular platform, people interested in specific communities will stay as long as reddit doesn&#x27;t piss them off. The beauty of reddit is that you can be interested in one or two niche communities, but you soak up the rest of the ecosystem along the way. If the masses go somewhere else and the niche communities are pushed away, there&#x27;s not much left.Also to clarify, I don&#x27;t mean niche as in small, I just mean specific hobbies or interests etc, that&#x27;s what reddit was good at - not needing to go to some forum to be able to talk about your thing. And by masses I mean whoever is participating in r&#x2F;pics or r&#x2F;funny or r&#x2F;tifu or whatever else. reply fsmv 15 hours agoprevPersonally I moved to lemmy and hackernews and stopped using reddit because the apps stopped working. reply bergie 15 hours agoparentI generally don’t use apps for things that have a decent website. Reddit was still in that category.But after they started doing stupid stuff I also moved to Lemmy, and haven’t looked back. reply h2odragon 16 hours agoprevHad as much impact as a fart in a hurricane.May a bit more: there were a few news stories about it, so it wasn&#x27;t totally silent; but I kinda doubt the people it was meant to impact were at all distressed. reply loxias 13 hours agoparentStrongly disagree, it was very impactful to me. A few communities I really liked and used for support up and left to other platforms, leading to other issues. I tried to follow some of them but it didn&#x27;t work. My take away of the blackout is \"reddit broke, lots of the good people left, life is more lonely as a result\". reply latency-guy2 12 hours agorootparentLots of bad people left too, which is probably a net good for reddit even if the number is lopsided for one or the other. reply unshavedyak 16 hours agoparentprevI disagree, it was impactful. More than a fart. What we have to look at is the impact though, not some specific objective that was impossible anyway (ie killing Reddit).The impact was massive attention to alternatives. Tons of traffic testing on said alternatives. Tons of press to activity pub, etc etc.It’s just like Mastodon. Every exodus was big for mastodon and activity pub. It gained traffic, interest, devs and users. Did it kill twitter? Of course not, but only fools thought it was likely to.Killing some massive social network is near impossible. But dismissing the twitter or Reddit drama as being irrelevant because they didn’t die is missing a lot of interesting development in the FOSS ecosystem imo. reply dimmke 9 hours agorootparentThis was always what annoyed me about people who took this position before the changes. The goalpost was \"Reddit is going to topple\" - it turns out that the effect of these platforms is so strong that short of them literally going down you aren&#x27;t going to see a full on collapse.I think it&#x27;s surprising because the collapse of sites like Digg and Myspace in the past, but the internet is a bigger&#x2F;much different place now.My prediction was the site is going to lose a lot of its niche communities and deep content will be diminished and the site will hollow out over time. It definitely seems like that&#x27;s what is happening. reply seesaw 12 hours agorootparentprevPersonally, I used to spend over an hour a day on Reddit. Now it has reduced to 10 minutes a week. Even when I go there, I see less quality posts at the top than before. So I think the blackout definitely had an impact, and Reddit is slowly going to become irrelevant. reply rchaud 15 hours agoparentprevIf it had such a minimal impact, downloads of the official app should be exploding. Haven&#x27;t heard anything suggesting that to be the case. reply rafram 14 hours agorootparentIt’s now the #1 most downloaded app in the news category on the App Store, ahead of Twitter and Nextdoor. So maybe downloads did explode? reply crazygringo 12 hours agorootparentIt seems like that data should be accessible at:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.similarweb.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;google-play&#x2F;com.reddit.frontp...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.similarweb.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;app-store&#x2F;1064216828&#x2F;statisti...But you need a paid account to access stats older than 28 days, and this needs the 6-month view (or even longer, ideally).Anyone here subscribe to Similarweb, and can answer for us?

The field is bifurcating into two different skill sets: ML engineer and ML scientist (or researcher).It&#x27;s great to have both types on a team. The scientists will be too slow; the engineers will bound ahead trying out various APIs and open-source models. But when they hit a roadblock or need to adapt an algorithm many engineers will stumble. They need an R&D mindset that is quite alien to many of them.This is when an AI scientists become essential. reply mi_lk 42 minutes agoparentI guess this message is delivered by an AI scientist, sure.It&#x27;s almost self-exploratory that when you hit a roadblock in practice you go back to foundations, and good people should aim to do both. In that case I don&#x27;t see where ML engineer&#x2F;scientist bifurcation comes from except for some to feel good about themselves reply 3abiton 50 minutes agoparentprevThis sounds like a sell-pitch for an AI scientist. reply gardenhedge 51 minutes agoparentprevWould you see these as analogous?The people who create the models and the people that use them.The people who create the programming languages and the people that use them. reply nsxwolf 12 hours agoprevAs someone who missed the boat on this, is learning about this just for historical purposes now, or is there still relevance to future employment? I just imagine the OpenAI eats everyone&#x27;s lunch in regards to anything AI related, am I way off base? reply GeneralMayhem 8 hours agoparentThe most important thing to learn for most practical purposes is what the thing can actually do. There&#x27;s a lot of fuzzy thinking around ML - \"throw AI at it and it&#x27;ll magically get better!\" Sources like Karpathy&#x27;s recent video on what LLMs actually do are good anti-hype for the lay audience, but getting good practical working knowledge that&#x27;s a level deeper is tough without working through it. You don&#x27;t have to memorize all the math, but it&#x27;s good to get a feel for the \"interface\" of the components. What is it that each model technique actually does - especially at inference time, where it needs to be well-integrated with the rest of the stack?In terms of continued relevance - \"deep learning\", meaning, dense neural nets trained to optimize a particular function, haven&#x27;t fundamentally changed in practice in ~15 years (and much longer than that in theory), and are still way more important and broadly used than the OpenAI stuff for most purposes. Anything that involves numerical estimation (e.g., ad optimization, financial modeling) is not going to use LLMs, it&#x27;s going to use a purpose-built model as part of a larger system. The interface of \"put numbers in, get number[s] out\" is more explainable, easier to integrate with the rest of your software stack, and more measurable. It has error bars that are understandable and occasionally even consistent. It has a controllable interface that won&#x27;t suddenly decide to blurt corporate secrets or forget how to serialize JSON. And it has much, much lower latency and cost - any time you&#x27;re trying to render a web page in under 100ms or run an optimization over millions of options, generative AI just isn&#x27;t a practical option (and is unlikely to become one, IMO).I don&#x27;t have a significant math or theoretical ML background, but I&#x27;ve spent most of the last 10 years working side by side with ML experts on infra, data pipelines, and monitoring. I&#x27;m not sure I could integrate the sigmoid off the top of my head, but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s important - I&#x27;ve done it once, enough to have some idea how the function behaves, and I know how to reason about it as a black box component. reply wilkystyle 7 hours agorootparent> Sources like Karpathy&#x27;s recent video on what LLMs actually do are good anti-hype for the lay audienceWhich video is this? reply bjacobt 7 hours agorootparentI believe op means Intro to Large Language Modelhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;zjkBMFhNj_g?si=XQQ3p92ajuQYOyqN reply deepsquirrelnet 10 hours agoparentprevThis is about deep learning, of which LLMs are a subset. If you are interested in machine learning, then you should learn deep learning. It is incredibly useful for a lot of reasons.Unlike other areas of ML, the nature of deep learning is such that its parts are interoperable. You could use a transformer with a CNN if you wish. Also, deep learning enables you to do machine learning on any type of data, text, images, video, audio. Finally, it can naturally scale computationally.As someone pretty involved in the field, I lament that LLMs are turning people away from ML and deep learning, and following the misconceptions that there’s no reason to do it anymore. Large algorithms are expensive to run, have slow throughput and are still generally poorer performing than purpose built models. They’re not even that easy to use for a lot of tasks, in comparison to encoder networks.I’m biased, but I think it’s one of the most fun things to learn in computing. And if you have a good idea, you can still build state of the art things with a regular gpu at your house. You just have to find a niche that isn’t getting the attention that LLMs are ;) reply dafaqueue 7 hours agorootparentI started off being really excited to learn, but as time went on I actually lost interest in the field.The whole thing is essentially curve fitting. The ML field is essentially an art more than a science and it&#x27;s all about tricks and intuitions on different ways of getting that best fit curve.From this angle the whole field got way less interesting. The field has nothing deeper or more insightful to offer beyond this concept of curve fitting. reply wiz21c 31 minutes agorootparentAlthough it fundamentally is curve fitting, I&#x27;d venture to say that at some point, having to handle millions of parameters makes the curve fitting problem unrecognizable... A change in quantity is a change is nature if you will.IOW: to me, fitting a generalized linear model is very different than fitting a convolutional network. reply dbmikus 2 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve found this fun way to think of it: the goal is to invent a faster form of evolution for pattern recognition, learning, and autonomous task completion. I think one needs to consider it more like biology and a science than pure logic and math. We can discover things that work, and then after that we can study them to learn why they work, just like we don&#x27;t fully understand the brain yet.I think there are some really cool problems, such as: 1. Is synthetic data viable for training? 2. How do you make deep learning agents that can do task planning and introspection in complex environments? 3. How do we efficiently build memory and data lookup into AI agents? And is this better&#x2F;worse than making longer context windows? reply Slix 2 hours agorootparentprevAre deep learning and neural networks just curve fitting? I thought those were significantly different. reply galangalalgol 1 hour agorootparentYou could argue all the building blocks are forms of curve fits, but that isn&#x27;t a terribly useful statement even if true. If you can fit a curve to the desired behavior of any function, or composition of functions (which is a function) then you can solve any problem you can express the desired behavior of. Including the expressing of desired behavior for some other class if problems. Saying it is just curve fitting is like saying something is just math. The entirety of reality is just math. reply niemandhier 1 hour agoparentprevSomeone will dominate the AI as a service marked, but there are so many applications for tiny edge ai that no single player can dominate all of them.OpenAI is for example not interested in developing small embedded neural networks that run on a sensor chip that real-time detects specific molecules in air. reply hedgehog 3 hours agoparentprevHighly relevant if you want to work on ML systems. Despite how much OpenAI dominates the press there are actually many, many teams building useful and interesting things. reply two_in_one 2 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s like calculus, nothing new in the last years, is it still important? The answer is still \"Yes\".After a glance, looks like too much for one book. Probably it was compressed with the assumption that reader already knows quite a lot. In other words it&#x27;s not an easy reading. reply ww520 7 hours agoparentprevFrom an application perspective, it&#x27;s more important to understand how the overall ML process work, the key concepts, and how things are fitted together. Deep Learning is a part of that. Lots of these are already wrapped in libraries and API, so it&#x27;s a matter of preparing the correct data, calling the right API&#x27;s, and utilizing the result. reply Slix 2 hours agoparentprevI came here with the same question. After reading and learning these materials, will I have new job skills or AI knowledge that I can do something with? reply quickthrower2 6 hours agoparentprevThis would be like learning how your CPU &#x2F; Memory works, even though JS is eating everyone&#x27;s (web front-end) lunch.So yes if you are prompt engineering, and wondering why X works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, and why any of this works at all, it is good to study a bit. reply ksherlock 11 hours agoparentprevMaybe last week&#x27;s drama should have been a left-pad moment. For many things you can train your own NN and be just as good without being dependent on internet access, third parties, etc. Knowing how things work should give you insight into using them better. reply mnky9800n 11 hours agorootparentWhich drama of last week are you referring to?

It&#x27;s probably the fastest paper ever to reach this significant milestone. Any deep learning book written before the Attention paper should be considered out of date, and needs updating.

Everything I ever worked on became obsolete pretty fast. From the ML algorithm to the compute platform, all of it was very transitory. That coupled with the fact that a few elite companies are responsible for all ML innovation, its oxymoronic to me to even learn a lot of this material. reply nabla9 11 hours agoparent>machine learning platformsMachine learning platforms become obsolete.Machine learning algorithms and ideas don&#x27;t. If learning SVN or Naive Bayes did not teach you things that are useful today, you didn&#x27;t learn anything. reply xcv123 11 hours agorootparentAgreed. Look at the table of contents of this book. Whatever fundamental machine learning concepts you learned with SVM or other obsolete algorithms is still useful and applicable today. reply ldjkfkdsjnv 11 hours agorootparentprevNobody is building real technology with either of those algorithms. Sure, they are theoretically helpful, but they arent valuable anymore. Spending your precious life learning them is a waste reply nabla9 10 hours agorootparent>Spending your precious life learning them is a wasteSo you really did not learn them.There is nothing wrong with being user. You don&#x27;t have to know how compilers work to use compiler. But then you should not say you understand compilers.In the same way, you probably would benefit from a book \"Using deep learning\", not \"Understanding deep learning\". reply ldjkfkdsjnv 10 hours agorootparentI know them and am a founder of a vc funded ai startup. Nobody is deploying naive bayes algorithms reply nabla9 10 hours agorootparent> Nobody is deploying naive bayes algorithmsExactly my point. You are so into user perspective that you think you are arguing against me. reply yeukhon 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah. But you didn’t build a plane without knowing physics right?Nobody deploys a textbook algorithm because everyone knows textbooks algorithms and there are no advantages. So, no, there is real value in learning the fundamentals, dear founder. reply Philpax 10 hours agorootparentprevYes, they’re not deploying them. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t still help to know the fundamentals of the field, especially when you’re trying to innovate. reply spencerchubb 7 hours agorootparentprevThis brings up an important question: Is a topic useful to learn if you will never use it in your life?To attempt answering this question, we can look at LLMs as an analogy. If you include code in the training set for an LLM, it also makes the LLM better at non-coding tasks, suggesting that sometimes learning something makes you also better at other things. I&#x27;m not saying the same necessarily applies for learning these \"old school\" AI techniques, but it&#x27;s a decently analogy at least. reply coef2 10 hours agorootparentprevI started my journey in machine learning fifteen years ago. Ironically, at that time, my professor told me that neural networks were outdated and trying them wouldn&#x27;t result in publishable research. SVMs were popular and emphasized in my coursework. I concur that SVMs don&#x27;t hold as much practical significance today. But the progress in AI and ML is generally unpredictable, and no one knows what theory leads to the next leap in the field. reply xcv123 11 hours agorootparentprevSo what? The same fundamental machine learning concepts are still relevant to deep learning.It&#x27;s almost like arguing that everything you learned as a Java developer is completely useless when a new programming language replaces it. reply wiz21c 27 minutes agoparentprevSo, what fundamental stuff should I learn ? I understand ML has some general principles that keeps on bein valid throughout the years. No ? reply tysam_and 7 hours agoparentprevHighly, highly disagree.If it became obsolete, then y&#x27;all were doing the new shiny.The fundamentals don&#x27;t really change. There are several different streams in the field, and there are many, many algorithms with good staying power in use. Of course, you can upgrade some if you like, but chase the white rabbit forever, and all you&#x27;ll get is a handful of fluff. reply HighFreqAsuka 11 hours agoparentprevQuite a lot of techniques in deep learning have stood the test of time at this point. Also new techniques are developed either depending on or trying to solved deficiencies in old techniques. For example Transformers were developed to solve vanishing gradients in LSTMs over long sequences and improve GPU utilization since LSTMs were inherently sequential in the time dimension. reply ldjkfkdsjnv 11 hours agorootparentSure, but if you were an expert in LSTM, thats nice, you know the lineage of algorithms. But it probably isnt valuable, companies dont care, and you cant directly use that knowledge. You would never just randomly study LSTMs now. reply opportune 8 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of transferrable skills you get from being an expert something that gets made obsolete by a similar-but-different iterative improvement. Maybe you&#x27;re really good at implementing ideas from papers, you have a great intuitive understanding of how to structure a model to utilize some tech within a particular domain, you understand very well how to implement&#x2F;use models that require state, you know how to clean and structure data to leverage a particular feature, etc.Also, being an \"expert in LSTM\" is like being an \"expert in HTTP&#x2F;1.1\" or \"knowing a lot about Java 8\". It&#x27;s not knowledge or a skill that stands on its own. An expert in HTTP&#x2F;1.1 is probably also very knowledge about web serving or networking or backend development. HTTP&#x2F;2 being invented doesn&#x27;t obsolete the knowledge at all. And that knowledge of HTTP&#x2F;1.1 would certainly come in handy if you were trying to research or design something like a new protocol, just as knowledge of LSTMs could provide a lot of value for those looking for the next breakthrough in stateful models. reply xcv123 7 hours agorootparentFYI, LSTMs are not obsolete. They are still the best option in many cases and are being deployed today. reply HighFreqAsuka 11 hours agorootparentprevTransformers have disadvantages too, and so LSTMs are still used in industry. But also it&#x27;s not that hard to learn a couple new things every year. reply reqo 11 hours agoparentprevVery few things stay the same in Technology.

You see these all over the place: foods, drinks, cars, etc. All table, no periodicity. Why are wrenches and drills strewn across three groups? Put the wrenches in one group, drills in the other. Impact drivers somewhere in between.There&#x27;s some vague grouping, but it&#x27;s pretty hodge podge.The way I would do it, is use electronegativity (tendency to give or remove electrons) as a proxy for additive&#x2F;subtractive. Atomic weight is a proxy for actual weight&#x2F;scale. Group I would be like clay forming (the OG additive process), concrete, FDM, SLS, injection molding, casting. Group II is a bit less additive, more bonding: hot glue, soldering, brazing, welding. Halogens hog out material: thermic lance, plasma cutter, laser, waterjet. Chalcogens: hand router, (power) router, lathe, mill.Metrology doesn&#x27;t add or subtract, so obviously that&#x27;s your Noble group.Transition metals are all the fasteners. Lanthanides&#x2F;Actinides are all the weirdos. I&#x27;d also add a group for just the simple machines. I think it&#x27;s more important to have groups, periodicity, and trends, than sticking to the exact shape&#x2F;size of the periodic table of elements.This is Theodore Gray too! Author of a bunch of books and posters on chemistry.Well, you know what they say, if you want something done right... reply RagnarD 10 hours agoparentYes. Good thoughts but bottom line, it&#x27;s trying to shoehorn something completely different into a form that makes it appear sophisticated. I think it just undercuts science. The periodic table is formed by important features of reality recognized in the elements, ultimately originating in quantum mechanics. Pretending that the structure applies to any capricious thing conveys an idea that the structure and reality is itself arbitrary. reply hoosieree 15 hours agoparentprevInclined planes form a column. Unguided inclined planes: knives, axes. Guided: planes, scissors. Inclined planes wrapped around cylinders: drills, screws.Blunt objects form a column: Hammers, presses, brakes.I agree with your categorizations involving tools that rely on heat, but I guess the problem with any such taxonomy is the next person comes along and goes \"well I would do this differently, and that...\" reply kortex 14 hours agorootparentObviously everyone has their own classification. But TFA doesn&#x27;t even distinct cutters from air pressure tools. I&#x27;d at least make a group for Fluid Workers: air compressor, water pump, hydraulic ram, hydraulic press. reply theodoregray 6 hours agorootparentOh, yes, you found another place where I had to make an arbitrary placement. Air pressure tools just did not fit anywhere else, so I slapped them there in transition metals, which is unforgivable. See my longer comment for more whining about how it&#x27;s not nearly as arbitrary as you make it out to be. reply theodoregray 6 hours agoparentprevYou complain that wrenches and drills are spread over several columns? Look at a periodic table please! The diagonal line splitting wrenches from drills is precisely the diagonal line splitting ordinary metals from non-metals. That’s one of the bits I’m most proud of!You have no idea how long I agonized over how to make this arrangement not be arbitrary, while at the same time dealing with some of the realities of how many tools of different kinds there are in different broad groupings.For example, as you say, wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense for measuring tools to be the noble gases, since they don’t change anything, unlike basically all other tools? That’s one of the first things I decided to do, because it’s so obvious. But there are simply too many measuring tools I wanted to include: they had to go in the lanthanides and&#x2F;or actinides, because those are bigger categories. Having a scale for additive vs. subtractive along an axis sounds great, but there are so many more subtractive tools than additive it would never work. Plus concrete tools, for example, didn’t even make the cut. They are literally not in there because, well, I just had too many other things to fit in that spark more joy for me (which is the ultimately the criterion for what I put in).In general, what I tried to preserve was (a) similar basic function within columns, (b) tools get bigger&#x2F;heavier as you go down a column, (c) transition metals are all related despite being spread over 10 columns, (d) lanthanides&#x2F;actinides being similar within rows instead of within columns (because it’s like they are actually all supposed to go in the third column, but that would just make the thing too wide), and (e) there’s a diagonal line between metals and non-metals.Beyond that I found a couple of small ways I could put in some analogies with actual chemical properties. For example, the halogens, which are hot, fiery elements, is where I put tools that use heat (soldering, welding, casting, 3D printing). But then I ran out of heat-related tools that made the cut to be categories, so I used the rest of that column for some categories that didn’t fit anywhere else: optical tools and toy tools. So sue me. Alkali earth metals (column 2) are not entirely dissimilar to alkali metals (column 1), so I put hammers in column 1 and things you might typically hit with a hammer in column 2. Imperfect, but there you go, and the counts worked out.The only individual element I could pay homage to was copper, element 29: that’s where I put all the brass and bronze non-sparking tools (which means they are otherwise in the wrong place, because all the other transition metals are cutting tools, but in space 29 I’ve got brass hammers and bronze wrenches. By all means rag on me for that choice too.I wanted to split single-edge cutting tools (knives, chisels, etc) and double-edge&#x2F;edge-and-anvil cutting tools (nippers, shears, etc) into the early and late transition metals, but the counts just didn’t work out, so I tearfully gave up on that.I’m happy someone at least noticed enough to complain, and actually it’s nice that I’m getting pushback on something as erudite as the suitability of my element&#x2F;tool analogies, as apposed to, for example, my risible opinions on titanium hammers (which are reflected only in the book, not the poster).As you say, I’m Theodore Gray and I should know better, right? Which is exactly why I just wrote an essay on why I’m right and this is not just an arbitrary jumble of tools! I spent months on this arrangement! OK, weeks, but it was a lot of time. I even wrote a Mathematica program that helped me pick 1- and 2-letter “element symbols” without ending up with any duplicates, even though that resulted in some weird and difficult-to-explain symbols (much as with actual atomic symbols).In conclusion, please keep the hate flowing and buy my poster and book.Thank you for coming to my TED talk, Theodore reply kuchenbecker 6 hours agorootparentThis is a classic \"we should refactor\" without understanding the original architecture&#x2F;decision making.No doubt some of the issues you describe become apparent when you actually attempt the task, yet it&#x27;s easy to propose a reasonable alternative.Anyway, I love that we both have a rebuttal to the original as well as a firm defense from the OP. reply croisillon 14 hours agoparentprevwe definitely need a periodic table of periodic tables reply theodoregray 6 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meta-synthesis.com&#x2F;webbook&#x2F;35_pt&#x2F;pt_database.php reply AareyBaba 14 hours agorootparentprevbut would it contain itself ? reply LeonB 8 hours agorootparentIf it is a periodic table of all periodic tables then yes it would contain itself.

Not their size. And perplexingly, miniature table saws are lumped in with other big saws.I&#x27;d also submit that a bung hole auger (lumped in with antique augers) is a reaming tool, not a drilling tool. Though one of the ones shown is a combination tool. There&#x27;s an auger at the front to drill the hole, followed by the reamer to ream the taper. The important bit is still the reamer though, meaning the tool could properly be called a bung hole reamer. reply theodoregray 5 hours agoparentOK, you&#x27;ve made the first criticism I actually agree with! Bung hole augers do belong with reamers, not with augers. In my defense, they are called bung hole augers, and all the ones I have are antique, so they naturally gravitated to the antique augers category, but I should have known better, and for that I am sorry. Some of them don&#x27;t even have augers at the front!The criticism of saws I reject: I split them by material in columns (wood- v.s metal-cutting), and by size vertically (getting heavier&#x2F;more powerful as you go down a column). Bow saws are under hacksaws kind of out of desperation, but there are at least as many metal-cutting bow saws as wood-cutting. In fact given the popularity of hacksaws, perhaps in modern times that is the more common application of this style of stretched blade. reply IshKebab 18 hours agoparentprevToo pedantic.

    "title": "VectorDB: Efficient Text Storage and Retrieval with Python Package",
    "originLink": "https://vectordb.com/",
    "originBody": "Description VectorDB is a lightweight Python package for storing and retrieving text using chunking, embedding, and vector search techniques. It provides an easy-to-use interface for saving, searching, and managing textual data with associated metadata and is designed for use cases where low latency is essential. Documentation and code VectorDB is open-source. Check VectorDB on GitHub for code and full documentation. Installation pip install vectordb2 Usage from vectordb import Memory memory = Memory() # text = \"...\" # metadata = {...} # Save text with metadata # This will automatically embed content memory.save(text, metadata) # Search for top n relevant chunks # We will automatically use the fastest vector search backend results = memory.search(query, top_n=3) Why use vector search and embeddings with large language models? Vector search and embeddings are essential when working with large language models because they enable efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information from massive datasets. By converting text into high-dimensional vectors, these techniques allow for quick comparisons and searches, even when dealing with millions of documents. This makes it possible to find the most relevant results in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional text-based search methods. Additionally, embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, which helps improve the quality of the search results and enables more advanced natural language processing tasks. Example from vectordb import Memory memory = Memory(chunking_strategy={'mode':'sliding_window', 'window_size': 128, 'overlap': 16}) text = \"\"\" Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms are trained on data sets that contain examples of the desired output. For example, a machine learning algorithm that is used to classify images might be trained on a data set that contains images of cats and dogs. Once an algorithm is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. For example, the machine learning algorithm that is used to classify images could be used to predict whether a new image contains a cat or a dog. Machine learning algorithms can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Some common applications of machine learning include: Classification: Categorizing data into different groups. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to classify emails as spam or not spam. Regression: Predicting a continuous value. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to predict the price of a house. Clustering: Finding groups of similar data points. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to find groups of customers with similar buying habits. Anomaly detection: Finding data points that are different from the rest of the data. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to find fraudulent credit card transactions. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. As the amount of data available continues to grow, machine learning is likely to become even more important in the future. \"\"\" metadata = {\"title\": \"Introduction to Machine Learning\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/introduction-to-machine-learning\"} memory.save(text, metadata) text2 = \"\"\" Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis. However, there is still a long way to go before AI can truly match the intelligence of humans. One of the main challenges is that human intelligence is incredibly complex and poorly understood. Despite the challenges, AI is a rapidly growing field with the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. Some of the potential benefits of AI include: Increased productivity: AI can be used to automate tasks that are currently performed by humans, freeing up our time for more creative and fulfilling activities. Improved decision-making: AI can be used to make more informed decisions, based on a wider range of data than humans can typically access. Enhanced creativity: AI can be used to generate new ideas and solutions, beyond what humans can imagine on their own. Of course, there are also potential risks associated with AI, such as: Job displacement: As AI becomes more capable, it is possible that it will displace some human workers. Weaponization: AI could be used to develop new weapons that are more powerful and destructive than anything we have today. Loss of control: If AI becomes too powerful, we may lose control over it, with potentially disastrous consequences. It is important to weigh the potential benefits and risks of AI carefully as we continue to develop this technology. With careful planning and oversight, AI has the potential to make the world a better place. However, if we are not careful, it could also lead to serious problems. \"\"\" metadata2 = {\"title\": \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence\"} memory.save(text2, metadata2) query = \"What is the relationship between AI and machine learning?\" results = memory.search(query, top_n=3) print(results)",

Thanks for submitting. To be fair this is not really a database, but a wrapper around few primitives such as locally-ran embeddings and FAISS&#x2F;mrpt with a ton of benchmarking behind the doors to offer sane defaults that minimize latency.Here is an example Colab notebook [1] where this is used to filter the content of the massive Kagi Small Web [2] RSS feed based on stated user interests:[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;1pecKGCCru_Jvx7v0WRN...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kagi.com&#x2F;smallweb reply ipsum2 22 hours agoprevThis is a wrapper around FAISS, a vector search library. FAISS has a simple API, so it might be a better for your use case if you don&#x27;t need heavyweight libraries that VectorDB requires, which include PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Transformers. reply dmezzetti 21 hours agoparentThis is possible but how would you encode your vectors? reply ipsum2 11 hours agorootparentBring your own embeddings. PyTorch and TensorFlow packages are 2GB+ each (don&#x27;t quote me on that), which is unnecessary if you&#x27;re making a network call to your favorite embedding service. reply sharemywin 18 hours agorootparentprevwhat&#x27;s wrong with these?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbert.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;pretrained_models.html reply pizza 10 hours agorootparentFor my use-case, I wanted whole-paragraph embeddings (iirc these are trained on max-256-token sentence pairs)Their simple suggestion to extend to longer texts is to pool&#x2F;avg sentence embeddings - but I&#x27;m not so sure that I want that; for instance eg that implies order between sentences didn&#x27;t matter. If I were forced to use sentence transformers for my use case, then the real fix would be to train an actual pooling model atop of the sentence embedder, but I didn&#x27;t want to do that either. At that point I stopped looking into it, but I&#x27;m certain there are newer models out nowadays that have both better encoders and handle much longer texts. The one nice thing about the sentence transformer models though is that they are much more lightweight than eg a 7B param language model reply dmezzetti 18 hours agorootparentprevAgreed and the question. If you take out the vector encoding part and just use Faiss, then what would be the proposal to encode vectors. reply lmeyerov 17 hours agorootparent... Whatever you want? Even with a vector DB, embeddings are typically BYO to beginwith - dependencies not in your DB and computed in pipelines well before it. It&#x27;s handy for small apps to do in DB and have support in DB for some queries, but as things get big, doing all in the DB gets weirder...Edit: I see you run a vectordb company, so your question makes more sense reply dmezzetti 17 hours agorootparentTrue but the comment discussed that it should remove \"heavyweight libraries\". Unless you use an API service, those libraries will need to be imported somewhere. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to run on the same server as the database. reply lmeyerov 17 hours agorootparentVector embedding at the app tier & orchestration &#x2F; compute tier make more sense for managing the dependency than the vector DB tier for the bulk of ML&#x2F;AI projects I&#x27;ve worked on. Round tripping through the vectordb would be an architectural, code, and perf headache. Ex: Just one of the many ways we use embeddings is as part of prefiltering what goes into the DB, running in a bulk pipeline in a diff VPC, and in a way we dont want to interfere with DB utilization.We generally avoid using embedding services to beginwith.. outside calls is the special case. Imagine something heavy like video transcription via Google APIs, not the typical one of &#x27;just&#x27; text embedding. The actual embedding is generally one step of broader data wrangling, so there needs to be a good reason for doing something heavy and outside our control... Which has been rare.Doing in the DB tier is nice for tiny projects, simplifying occasional business logic, etc, but generally it&#x27;s not a big deal for us to run encode(str) when building a DB query.Where DB embedding support gets more interesting to me here is layering on additional representation changes on top, like IVF+PQ... But that can be done after afaict? (And supporting raw vectors generically here, vs having to align our python & model deps to our DB&#x27;s, is a big feature) reply bugglebeetle 10 hours agorootparentprevFor English-language embeddings, the bge models from the Beijing Academy of Artificial intelligence outperform SBERT. There is a leaderboard somewhere on Hugging Face, but I can’t find it at the moment. reply politelemon 20 hours agoprevIf a team has an operational store already in Postgres, wouldn&#x27;t it be best to just use the PGVector extension?

I wouldn&#x27;t say there is enough in common. reply andy99 22 hours agoprevThe two most interesting things to me in a \"minimal\" framework would be eliminating dependency on HF transformers and helping customize chunking.Not a knock against this project, I see where it can be helpful. reply jsimian 15 hours agoparentYeah, I just tried this out (props to the devs, super easy to set up) and my main gripe is the chunking algorithms aren&#x27;t great - could be alot more useful with a context option that gives surrounding results to search results. The sliding window chunking method always cuts off the start of sentences. reply andy99 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve found it works better to chunk by some logical sections in the document, e.g header h2 h3 h4 etc or 1.1 1.1.1 ... plus to be able to ignore some stuff (header and footer) plus other customizations.At least for use cases where there are clusters of many similarly formatted documents, it would be cool to have a way of easily customizing chunking. reply dmezzetti 22 hours agoparentprevMy assumption is that this gives you the ability to locally encode vectors. This is useful for those not using API services to build their vectors. reply andy99 21 hours agorootparentTransformer inference is ~60 lines of numpy[0] (closer to 500 once you add tokenization etc). It would be nice to just have this and not all of pytorch and transformers.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jaykmody.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gpt-from-scratch&#x2F; reply cherryteastain 21 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s 60 lines for CPU only inference, which&#x27;ll be slow. If you want GPU acceleration it&#x27;ll be a lot more than 60 lines. reply dmezzetti 21 hours agorootparentprevWhat about models besides GPT? Most of the popular vector encoding models aren&#x27;t using this architecture.If you really didn&#x27;t want PyTorch&#x2F;Transformers, you could consider exporting your models to ONNX (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;onnxruntime). reply hubraumhugo 18 hours agoprevIs there any kind of comaprison of the different vector DBs?

It trades off searchability with understanding (or getting an indication of) what it is when you first hear of it. reply worldsayshi 10 hours agorootparentI think there&#x27;s two ways to name things and I think the cattle or pet metaphor is useful here.If the typical user will use the thing once and then forget about it or if they are not going to keep it in mind very often make sure to give it a descriptive name.But for some things having a descriptive name might not be the most important aspect of its name. Having a findable or memorable name might be more important. And maybe sometimes giving it a descriptive name might actually become a problem because its function might change over time. replyPossiblyKyle 22 hours agoprevI fail to understand why I should use it over a different embedded vector DB like LanceDB or Chroma. Both are written in more performant languages, have a simple API with a lot of integrations and power if one needs it reply dmezzetti 22 hours agoparentTo be fair, Chroma is also written in Python.

Some libraries such as Hugging Face&#x27;s tokenizers even use Rust.I referenced this article below but will reference it again here too. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neuml.hashnode.dev&#x2F;building-an-efficient-sparse-keyw....You can write performant code in any language if you try. reply aldanor 20 hours agorootparentNumPy is a C library with Python frontend, moreover lots of functionality based on other existing C libraries like blas etc.PyTorch, quoting themselves, is a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework; also optionally depending on existing libs like mkl etc.> You can write performant code in any language if you try.Unfortunately, only to a certain extent. Sure, if you just need to multiply a handful of matrices and you want your blas ops to be blas&#x27;ed where the sheer size of data outweighs any of your actual code, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. Once you need to implement lower-level logic, ie traversing and processing the data in some custom way, especially without eating extra memory, you&#x27;re out of luck with Python&#x2F;numpy and the rest. reply benrutter 19 hours agorootparent> NumPy is a C library with Python frontendI guess this is a pretty legitimate take, but in that case VectorDB looks like (from the got repo) it makes huge use of libraries like pytorch and numpy.If numpy is fast but \"doesn&#x27;t count\" because the operations aren&#x27;t happening in python, then I guess VectorDB isn&#x27;t in python either by that logic?On the other hand, if it is in Python despite shipping operations out to C&#x2F;C++ code, then I guess numpy shows that can be an effective approach? reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentprevBLAS can be implemented in any language. In terms of LOC, most BLAS might be C libraries, but the best open source BLAS, BLIS, is totally structured around the idea of writing custom, likely assembly, kernels for a platform. So, FLOPs-wise it is probably more accurate to call it an assembly library.LAPACK and other ancillary stuff could be Fortran or C.Anyway, every language calls out to functions and runtimes, and compiles (or jits or whatever) down to lower level languages. I think it is just not that productive to attribute performance to particular languages. Numpy calls BLAS and LAPACK code, sure, but the flexibility of Python also provides a lot of value.How does Numba fit into this hierarchy? reply mgl 20 hours agorootparentprevThis is unfortunately not correct once you start pushing the boundaries requiring careful allocation of memory, CPU cache and COU itself, see this table:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stratoflow.com&#x2F;efficient-and-environment-friendly-pr... reply _a_a_a_ 20 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t accept that. In the referenced article you&#x27;re pulling in stuff which I believe is written in a different language (probably C). If you use native python, I&#x27;m sure you would accept it would be much slower and take up much more memory.

But that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be productive and performant using these types of strategies to speed up where necessary. reply _a_a_a_ 19 hours agorootparentWith respect, I think you&#x27;re clouding things by trying to defend what is really defensible. Okay then.> Where do you draw the line?Drawing the line at native python, not pulling in packages that are written in another language. Packages written in python only are acceptable in this argument.> But that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be productive and performant using these types of strategies to speed up where necessary.No one said it couldn&#x27;t. What we&#x27;re saying is that it pure python is &#x27;slow&#x27; and you need to escape from pure python to get the speedups. reply dmezzetti 19 hours agorootparentI agree that pure Python isn&#x27;t as fast as other options.

In short: We're \"mostly\" done. Quantifying that isn't all that easy because there are separate measurements - do you use lines or bytes, do you use rust vs C++ or do you use the amount of C++ that was removed? Depending on how you count, we're at anywhere between 60% (c++ sloc removed) and 74% (rust sloc vs c++ sloc) done. And a lot of that is scaffolding we've duplicated that can be removed once the last caller is gone, so you get a bit of a domino effect. E.g. we have already translated wgetopt, but kept the C++ version around until the last caller is translated, which is simpler than adding translation gunk to all the C++ callers. What is left to do? The last big component that remains to be translated is the reader with the input system. This is 3.5k for the reader plus 1.3k for the screen handling plus 1k line for input plus 700 lines for the pager. This is pretty tightly coupled. After that the rest is some stragglers and the de-C++ifying of the build system - removing cmake, getting cargo to do everything we want (cmake still substantially drives the build, and we need e.g. cargo to build and install the documentation and completion files. this isn't just compiling a bunch of rust, we have a lot of auxilliary stuff!) This isn't really the sort of thing drive-by contributions are good for, I'm afraid. Alright, that's the update, now for answering some questions correcting some misconceptions I've seen in what I assume is this reddit thread: We will be removing all of the C++. A windows port is not planned, and has never been planned. C++ is also perfectly well-supported on Windows, so rust doesn't really help here. The language has never been the problem with a windows port, the problem is that windows is not unix! We won't be changing the name or the mascot. We probably won't add \"written in rust\" to the tag line (but we might mention it on https://fishshell.com/) We have no real idea what the performance of the finished port is going to be. Early results are encouraging, but it is entirely possible this will be ~20% slower in some cases. Even once the initial port is done, the project won't be. There's a loooot to do. 54 131 1 70 5 66 31 9 Replies: 3 comments · 8 replies Oldest Newest Top PoignardAzur We won't be changing the name or the mascot.

That means we would be doing e.g. fish 4.0 as fully rust and zero C++, and I think, contrary to what we usually do that warrants a beta. (Ordinarily we've stopped doing betas and release candidates because they simply don't get any testing). We also still want to do a 3.7.0 in-between release that is still purely C++, so we have a better jumping off point for platforms that can't handle the rust version. It would be 3.6.1 with some neat changes backported. 4 10 8 4 1 reply faho Maintainer Author 3.7.0 is built in the Integration_3.7.0 branch in case you want to see what's happening there - including the (preliminary) CHANGELOG. Highlights: A timeout for key combinations, useful for binding \"kj\" or \"jj\" to switching mode in vi-mode Usability improvements with the history-pager (ctrl-r) - e.g. it'll start with the existing search if you decide to switch from up-arrow to ctrl-r Some rendering glitches are fixed Faster globs Berrysoft You have done a really hard work to port the code from C++ to Rust. As a user of fish, I admire your perseverance. I'm also a Windows user. I use fish with MSYS2 environment, which is a fork of cygwin. Fish ran really well on it because it provides POSIX utilities. However, Rust doesn't provide a cygwin or MSYS2 target, which means fish cannot be compiled target cygwin or MSYS2 after rewritten by Rust. The language was not a problem with a Windows port, but it will be. I'm just a user, so this comment is just a reminder, that the rewriting work might block some fish users on Windows to update their favorite shell. I'm not blaming the work or the language. Anyway, Windows is not Unix:) Thanks again for all of your hard work. 6 5 replies faho Maintainer Author The major blocking issue there is that cygwin does not have an llvm maintainer. It appears that cygwin is in need of some love, llvm is the second-most popular open source compiler. It is a big and important package. Until then, you'd have to use WSL on windows, which has a lot of things going for it from our perspective - it's much closer to linux in behavior, which makes handling it much nicer. But yeah, this is an argument for making a 3.7.0 release with C++ - so cygwin at least gets up to there. 4 Berrysoft It's rather common to cross-compile on Windows, and fish doesn't need LLVM. So LLVM is not the major blocking issue. It is Rust team itself doesn't have much interest on that target. The crates, libc, cc, compiler_builtins etc., have no knowledge about cygwin target. I don't think it is your responsibility to consider these compatibility issues because fish shell initially didn't plan for Windows. But please don't give advice about using WSL. WSL is Linux, not Windows. It won't be better if many works need to be on Windows. edited LoganDark It won't be better if many works need to be on Windows. WSL will still find .exe's in PATH and execute them. What can you do in Cygwin that you can't do with WSL? Is all you need a shared process namespace, or is it access to Win32 APIs directly, or what? nightkr However, Rust doesn't provide a cygwin or MSYS2 target The x86_64-pc-windows-gnu should be usable with MSYS2. I don't use it regularly (not a Windows user), but I was able to get it to compile some other stuff in MSYS2 a few days ago. 3 RReverser The x86_64-pc-windows-gnu should be usable with MSYS2. I don't use it regularly (not a Windows user), but I was able to get it to compile some other stuff in MSYS2 a few days ago. Same, that's more or less the designated target for MSYS2. I've used it to build Rust code with some libraries that were ported from Linux but only to MSYS2 (as in, with bunch of other MSYS2 packages as dependencies). 2 Sign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.

I mixed up the module name. It&#x27;s the sh module https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sh.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F; sort_env = os.environ.copy() sort_env[\"LANG\"] = \"C\" sh.wc(\"-l\", _in=sh.uniq(\"-c\", _piped=True, _in=sh.sort(_env=sort_env, _piped=True, _in=sh(\"some-command\", _piped=True, _err_to_out=True)))) It&#x27;s not as natural in some ways for most people because you have to write it right to left instead of left to right as with the pipe syntax. If you split it over multiple lines it&#x27;s better: some_command = sh(\"some-command\", _piped=True, _err_to_out=True) sorted = sh.sort(_env=sort_env, _piped=True, _in=some_command) unique = sh.uniq(\"-c\", _piped=True, _in=sorted) word_count = sh.wc(\"-l\", _in=unique)There&#x27;s also all sorts of helpful stuff you can do like invoking a callback per line or chunk of output, with contexts for running a sequence of commands as sudo, etc etc.And of course, you don&#x27;t actually need to shell out to sort&#x2F;uniq either: output_lines = sh(\"some-command\", _err_to_out=True).splitlines() num_lines = len(list(set(output_lines)))This is also cheaper because it avoids the sort which isn&#x27;t strictly necessary for determining the number of unique lines (sorting is typically going to be an expensive way to do that for large files compared to a hash set because of the O(nlogn) string comparisons vs O(n) hashes).It&#x27;s really quite amazing and way less error prone too when maintaining anything more complicated. Of course, I&#x27;ve found it not as easy to develop muscle memory with it but that&#x27;s my general experience with libraries. reply js2 7 hours agorootparentprevI really don&#x27;t find using subprocess all that tedious personally.

That&#x27;s how all bash functions process their parameters.Set IFS only if you really need to. But in that case also consider something like xargs where you are not limited by environment, have null terminated fields, and offer parallelism.Arrays are only useful when you need multidimensionality, at which point you should probably look at using data files and process with other tools such as sed.

And porting to c++17 is probably high on the latter... reply stouset 13 hours agorootparentAnd this is quite literally the argument put forth by the maintainers. They could upgrade to a newer C++, but it’s a lot of hassle with few benefits.On the other hand they chose to port to Rust which is likely an even bigger hassle but comes along with a bunch of benefits that make planned future development significantly easier. reply trealira 14 hours agorootparentprevThey said that they thought it wasn&#x27;t worth updating from C++11 to C++17. In their defense, C++17 adds only some incremental changes.

It will also somewhat lower the barrier to contributing for a lot of people, including myself.Another thing I&#x27;m very excited about, which has received less attention, is the planned future fish rewrite to use UTF-8 instead of wchar_t (typically UTF-16).

They make some very strong, opinionated choices (like ditching POSIX compatibility), and the end result is an extremely nice shell. I&#x27;ve been using it for a bit over a decade now, and still love it.Fish shell scripting is also extremely pleasant to write, it feels like an ergonomic bash.There are a few warts, as with any project, but none of them have ever actually ever blocked me from just getting what I wanted done. reply ianschmitz 12 hours agoprevAs someone who uses zsh + spaceship, what benefits would I gain moving to fish as my main shell? I don’t write many bash scripts so the scripting side is less of a concern. reply MrJohz 12 hours agoparentIf you&#x27;ve already set up your zsh as you like it, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a huge amount of benefit. The big benefit of fish is that it&#x27;s pretty much the ideal shell, but straight out of the box, without configuration. Autocomplete just works, navigating the history is easy, it completes commands from your history, choosing a shell prompt can be as simple as opening a browser, etc. You can customise it pretty much as deeply as you need to - just like zsh - but the defaults are good enough that you&#x27;ve got a really nice shell out of the box. reply butshouldyou 44 minutes agoparentprevSpeed!fish does a lot out of the box that I needed plugins for in zsh. zsh&#x27;s plugins are slow, so my shell startup was over three seconds. fish starts way faster, even with plugins. reply acdha 10 hours agoparentprevMy rationale for picking fish over zsh in 2017 was that it had everything I wanted included, as was quite noticeably faster. Since then I’ve spent almost no time maintaining shell configuration, which has been pleasant. reply kstrauser 7 hours agoparentprevThe first time I learned to write my own shell prompt by creating a file named “fish_prompt.fish” in the right directory, then writing a function in it named “fish_prompt” that echos a string to stdout, I was nearly ready to uninstall zsh. Using it ruined me on stuffing stuff into $PS1 and crossing my fingers.I highly recommend everyone at least try it for a few days, if only to see what kinds of things you’d always taken granted are actually shell-specific. Worst case: you say “this isn’t for me” and go back to bash&#x2F;zsh&#x2F;whatever happy that you’re still using your favorite shell. reply petepete 10 hours agoparentprevI switched from zsh to fish a couple of years ago. My setups are very similar in capability but my fish config is about 10% the size. I get nearly everything I want for free and now only use one plugin, fzf.fish reply DoctorDabadedoo 12 hours agoparentprevTbh, little, mostly convenience (best metaphor I can give is installing Sublime Text vs manually installing your vim and your own personal configs). By default it supports a bunch of interesting things, autocomplete, iteractive filesystem navigation, theming (I used oh-my-fish in the past, not sure how it is now), etc.I like it, I would love to run it as my main shell, but I just do too much scripting for my own good to hop on this wagon. reply tipsytoad 12 hours agoparentprevEh, you can probably get very similar to fish with zsh + loads of plugins, but fish has lots of niceties out of the box (syntax highlighting, autosuggestion based on your directory). I&#x27;ve been using fish + starship with just a fzf plugin and it&#x27;s got everything I need.Check it out, it&#x27;s effective with very little config reply ilaksh 12 hours agoparentprevFor me it&#x27;s really about the autocomplete. reply acheong08 4 hours agoprevBeen using fish for a year. Although I don’t like how they break compatibility with standards so that some scripts don’t work (gvm, nvm, etc), it has all the features I would usually set up manually with zsh. After trying to configure zsh a few different machines, I gave up and went for default fish on all of them.It’s already working so well, not sure what there is to gain by porting to Rust. Security? If something can maliciously tamper with fish, it’s probably already on your system or am I missing something? reply paradox460 24 minutes agoparentThey have a variety of reasons to move to rust, as outlined in their original rust discussion[1]. Mostly around finding other contributors, and adding an async&#x2F;parallel mode they&#x27;re comfortable with.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fish-shell&#x2F;fish-shell&#x2F;pull&#x2F;9512 reply behnamoh 14 hours agoprevone of the fastest shells out there will probably get even faster. ever since I switched from zsh to fish, my terminal productivity has gone up a lot. reply nick__m 14 hours agoparentI would not bet on this!from the link : We have no real idea what the performance of the finished port is going to be. Early results are encouraging, but it is entirely possible this will be ~20% slower in some cases. reply tubthumper8 7 hours agorootparentThis part also seems relevant:> Fish also uses threads, for things like the autosuggestion and syntax highlighting, and we would like to have more \"threads\"&#x2F;\"concurrency\"&#x2F;\"run-thing-in-backgroundness\" (please insert the correct term here, I have never been good at these things). One large project has been to run multiple fish builtins and functions \"at the same time\", to enable things like backgrounding functions (ideally without using \"subshells\" because those are an annoying environment boundary that shows up in surprising places in other shells), and to simply be able to pipe two builtins into each other and have them actually process both ends of the pipe \"simultaneously\".> C++ offers few guarantees on what can be accessed from which thread. @ridiculousfish has been trying to crack this for years, and hasn&#x27;t been confident enough in his solution. We want a tech stack that helps us here, and C++ doesn&#x27;t.The initial rewrite may be no faster, or possibly slower as stated, but long-term they&#x27;d be able to safely add more concurrency or parallelism that they weren&#x27;t able to before. reply bayindirh 14 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think C++ and Rust has that big of a performance difference. They are probably neck to neck with no clear winner. reply andrewaylett 10 hours agorootparentThe advantages of Rust come when trying to do complex things with concurrency, and wanting to know that they&#x27;re either going to be safe, or fail to compile.Consider the now-classic \"Fearless Concurrency\" post about Stylo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.rust-lang.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;14&#x2F;Fearless-Concurrency-I...Strictly, C++ pretty much has to be no slower than Rust. But it&#x27;s certainly possible that a regular human might in practice write higher-performing parallel code when using Rust. reply ordu 8 hours agorootparentAt the same time Rust forbids some practices pushing a coder to choose another path. To name a specific example, try to roll out your own dynamically sized type type or a self-referential one. Such small things could contribute to performance too. reply joshlk 13 hours agorootparentprevIn Rust it’s easier to leverage external crates&#x2F;libraries that are more optimised than rolling your own. This can lead to performance increases (I don’t know if fish is doing this) reply bayindirh 12 hours agorootparentI have never experienced difficulties adding high (HPC level) performance libraries into my code. Can you elaborate? reply dwattttt 11 hours agorootparentIt definitely makes a difference around threading; exposing thread safety in function API makes it easy to understand where&#x2F;how you can add threading support, or what is preventing it. reply starcraft2wol 13 hours agorootparentprevC programs without libraries tend to be really fast for the opposite reason. So this isn’t persuasive even though it seems like it should be true reply acdha 10 hours agorootparentThis is only true for very simple single-threaded code. Once you’re doing anything the compiler can’t trivially optimize, you’re using libraries, getting left far behind by the Rust program, or both. reply starcraft2wol 7 hours agorootparentSince most industrial software is in C and C++ an example would be more convincing.> doing anything the compiler can’t trivially optimizeWhat does compiler optimization have to do with libraries?> single threadedPlenty of C and C++ programs are multi threading using a system api like pthreads. reply LoganDark 14 hours agorootparentprevThe real difference is in compile-time abstractions. It&#x27;s much easier to organize things in Rust, especially with a borrow checker. You can confidently remove overhead while being sure that it&#x27;ll continue to be memory safe. reply bayindirh 14 hours agorootparentWith some strong design decisions, and with modern C++ facilities, you can make sure that your code never does funny things in C++, too.Yes, Rust&#x27;s BC is a great technology, but C++ is not a runaway nuclear fire which contaminates and melts everything around it when it comes to sanity and security.Yes, Rust allows you to run amok by not allowing it, but you can design a good foundation to your code which prevents tons of problems out of the gate in C++, and this is without using smart-pointers and other things available to you. reply pdpi 14 hours agorootparent> but you can design a good foundation to your code which prevents tons of problems out of the gate in C++,And there is an almost perfect overlap between the people capable of pulling off a rewrite like this and the people who would write a good C++ foundation in the first place. reply LoganDark 11 hours agorootparentprev> Yes, Rust&#x27;s BC is a great technology, but C++ is not a runaway nuclear fire which contaminates and melts everything around it when it comes to sanity and security.I never meant to imply such a thing. However, Rust is simply a much better-defined language. Moves do what you expect, smart pointers work like you&#x27;d expect, there are not 3 (or 5) different types of constructors you have to understand and implement properly if you want to build your own abstractions. You don&#x27;t have to remember where to put std::move, you don&#x27;t have to remember what happens to the variable after you move out of it, you don&#x27;t have to use the awful variant accessor functions if you want a tagged union and so on.Yes, you can do all this in C++. You can build safe abstractions. You can build layers on top of the STL to make it less awful. You can make use of modules and #embed and other nice new features that C++ is getting. But you need to be a lot more careful compared to Rust, because the compiler is not going to help you. reply fbdab103 14 hours agoparentprevIs shell performance a limitation for some workflows? I naively think of it as some glue which shunts the work elsewhere. Maybe in the efficiency of pipe? I suppose those lunatics who write full programs in bash?I will always take faster code, but that seems like an odd bulletpoint to highlight given the many quality of life improvements fish has to offer. reply kstrauser 14 hours agorootparentKind of, yeah. When I used zsh, oh-my-zsh made the shell startup a lot slower, even though I wasn’t going crazy with the customizations. Opening a new terminal tab would take a couple seconds to get a prompt. My current fish setup is imperceptibly fast to start.Those little delays add friction. Not an intolerable amount, sure, but it’s there. While I switched to fish for other reasons, that alone would keep me from going back now. reply coldtea 14 hours agorootparent>Kind of, yeah. When I used zsh, oh-my-zsh made the shell startup a lot slower, even though I wasn’t going crazy with the customizationsA lot or most of that wasn&#x27;t zsh being slow though, but oh-my-zsh calling out to external programs (like git to get powerline info and such) and them being slow. reply arp242 13 hours agorootparentSee my other comment from earlier today[1] – launching 230 external programs (even very simple ones, &#x2F;bin&#x2F;[ in this case) takes about half a second. Since I would rate anything as >100ms to be a \"noticeable delay\" you have a \"budget\" of about 40 external processes, probably a bit less in real-world conditions (depending on which utilities you&#x27;re using and what it&#x27;s doing).And that&#x27;s 40 C processes. \"python empty.py\" takes about 30ms to 40ms due to the interpreter startup time; empty C file is about 2ms, \"sh empty.sh\" is about 4ms.Please think that \"launching external programs is fast and modern computers are fast, so why worry about this?\", and that&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s also not.

I don’t think zsh is bad. I understand what was making it slow. I’m just glad I can have all of those niceties plus fish’s speed. reply lkbm 14 hours agorootparentprevI once spent a while adding timings between each item in my zsh config files to find what was slowest.The nvm init was the worst of it, so now I have an alias for `$NVM_DIR&#x2F;nvm.sh ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR&#x2F;nvm.sh\" && \\. $NVM_DIR&#x2F;bash_completion` I just run manually before using nvm, rather than letting it slow me down half a second or whatever it was every time I open a new terminal.It&#x27;s worth poking around if things get slow enough to be a pain.

Is there anybody who can share their experiences with issues and workarounds in this area? reply 22c 7 hours agoparentPOSIX compliance is practically a non-issue for fish as it&#x27;s not intended to be a replacement for bash&#x2F;shell scripts. It&#x27;s intended to be an interactive shell (eg. your daily driver) and to that end, it&#x27;s quite good.The downside of this is that you do need to \"context switch\" a little, especially if you&#x27;ve been using bash&#x2F;zsh for most of your life. I find it easy to differentiate between when I am using the shell as a user interface and when I&#x27;m using bash&#x2F;sh as an interpreter, but for others that might not be as intuitive.I&#x27;ve also found that since I&#x27;ve stopped using POSIX compliant shells as my daily driver, I tend to \"promote\" my scripts to a more general purpose language much sooner than I used to when nearly everything could be done in bash. reply esafak 14 hours agoprevWhy, was the C++ codebase becoming unmanageable? reply theshrike79 14 hours agoparentComment by the creator: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fish-shell&#x2F;fish-shell&#x2F;pull&#x2F;9512#issuecomm...tl;dr - string handling - threading - cmake issues reply darthrupert 14 hours agoparentprevBecoming? reply DoctorDabadedoo 12 hours agorootparentI was raised in C++ spaguetti code bases, I didn&#x27;t see a loved and well groomed project until I became a man. reply asylteltine 13 hours agoprevI’m glad rust is replacing legacy languages like C and C++.

Because it&#x27;s in a container, localhost does not get resolved to the Windows host, so if you have stuff that&#x27;s spread across both OS it&#x27;s also annoying. Also has weird issues with corporate VPNs. And the other day switching to fish shell as default would just freeze the whole container with no way to debug it, WTF? Unlike a real Linux env, it&#x27;s a black box, if it starts acting weird your best bet is just to trash and recreate it.I mean, it works and gives a somewhat decent Linux CLI experience but personally I stick with MSYS2 whenever I can so I have a single env to deal with. reply exxos 12 hours agorootparentprev [–] It does.With Go, it would have worked out of the box on all the targets Go can support. reply Cu3PO42 12 hours agorootparent> It does.It works in Cygwin right now, it doesn&#x27;t work on Win32 without a compatibility layer.

    "originLink": "https://monzo.com/blog/2023/09/06/making-it-clear-when-were-on-a-call-with-you/",
    "originBody": "If someone calls you claiming to be from Monzo, you can now check to see if they’re telling the truth or not in the Monzo app. It’s a new feature we designed to stop fraudsters from tricking you into sending them money by convincing you they work for Monzo. If we say we’re not talking to you, hang up Here’s how it works. If someone calls and tells you they work for Monzo, open your Monzo app and head to ‘Privacy & security’ in Settings by tapping your profile in the top left of the Home screen. If the ‘Monzo call status’ is showing that a member of the Monzo team isn’t talking to you, hang up right away and report it to us. You can start a report by tapping the call status. If the call status in your app shows that a member of the Monzo team is on the phone with you, you’re okay to continue the call. The call status doesn’t lie Even if the person you’re talking to tries to tell you there’s a technical issue or that they’re from a specialist team that wouldn’t show on the call status, don’t believe them. Hang up and report the attempted fraud to us through the app. For times where you’re not connected to the internet, the call status will reflect that. In this situation we recommend that you don’t speak to anyone claiming they’re from Monzo until you’re connected to the internet again and can check the call status. Things we’ll never ask you Remember, we will never call you without arranging it with you first through in-app chat. And if we do call you we’ll always make sure we go through some security questions before discussing anything to do with your account. We’ll also never ask you to: send money to a holding account, safe account or any other account withdraw money from a Pot make a payment or send money for any reason accept a notification on your phone ignore a fraud or payment warning give us your PIN or any personal information take out a loan or use Monzo Flex. Protecting you against impersonation scams Last year alone, people in the UK lost around £170 million to impersonation scams. Which is the very type of scam this new feature helps protect you against. An impersonation scam is when a criminal pretends to be someone else so they can encourage you to send them money. It’s sometimes called a bank transfer scam or authorised push payment fraud. By adding the Monzo call status to your app we’re making it possible for you to confirm whether who you’re speaking to is really from Monzo or not. Our hope is that this could stop instances of impersonation scams for Monzo customers altogether. People are using this to report fraud more than 100 times a day Since we launched this feature, we’ve seen that customers are using it on average around 100 times a day to report suspected fraud. Now it’s live and protecting customers, our next step is to think about how to make it more visible. Privacy & settings – where it lives now – is a natural home for it, but we think it should appear elsewhere too. Somewhere more visible and easier to find if you’re on a call and you want to quickly check that who you’re speaking to is who they say they are. Stay tuned for updates.

My account was locked and I had to go into a branch, present 2 forms of photo ID to create a new userID and password and be able to use my cards&#x2F;access my (new) account again.I had some very strong words for the branch manager and anyone who would listen about how terrible a security practice it is to give those sorts of conflicting instructions. reply jkaplowitz 15 hours agoparentThe complaint should go to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (Chase’s primary regulator) + the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (their consumer regulator if you’re a non-business account) + the media, not to the branch manager. I doubt the branch manager has any control over this policy or any way to communicate your frustrations to anywhere with power to act on them.That said, maybe they’ve fixed this since it happened to you: as of 2023, Chase’s Sapphire credit card department seems to be able to verify my transactions as legitimate or fraudulent and complete my live identification to a customer service representative without replicating your experience. They allow me to validate transactions by replying to email or SMS notifications which mention the specific transaction, and they can involve their mobile app in attempts to live verify my identity. reply nolongerthere 14 hours agorootparent> That said, maybe they’ve fixed this since it happened to you: as of 2023, Chase’s Sapphire credit card department seems to be able to verify my transactions as legitimate or fraudulent and complete my live identification to a customer service representative without replicating your experience.

Obv, if they suspect my account was hacked there really isn&#x27;t a way to verify using any of the existing account info. reply everforward 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is how my bank handles it as well. I just get a text with the charge line and amount, and it prompts me to reply either YES or NO (or maybe STOP, it&#x27;s been a while). If I say YES or STOP, it stops payment and prompts me to call whatever the department for that is with a phone number.It seems to also hint to their fraud system. I think the last one I got was when I was traveling, and it quit asking if the charges were authentic after the first couple. reply jey 13 hours agorootparentProbably not \"STOP\" since that&#x27;s a reserved message in SMS that tells bots to stop messaging you entirely. reply kazinator 2 hours agoparentprevLet&#x27;s assume that whoever you&#x27;re talking to is either really with the bank or some crook who does not have access to any of your banking information.You can simply ask the crook to name the amounts and descriptions of the last several transactions in your primary checking account. Or the statement amount of your most recent credit card bill on a particular card. reply jcul 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve done this kind of thing before when I&#x27;ve received calls.Sometimes gets weird reactions from the caller but they usually comply. reply katee 15 hours agoparentprevAre you sure it was really a Chase representative on the phone with you?

Though it sounded like it was someone in a local office and not part of a large call center team. reply drdaeman 13 hours agoparentprev> Really what we need is reverse 2FANo. What we really need is a mutual authentication, where both parties talking over a phone can confirm each other&#x27;s identity simultaneously, as a part of a single process (assuming a previously established secret(s)). Ideally, with a piece of human-readable metadata attached to it that describes the purpose of authentication.So banks no longer ask you to read back a SMS, and you no longer guess if that&#x27;s legit and you both know what this authentication is for (spelled out in a natural language).If you have Internet connectivity, it should use it to perform all the communications, leaving both sides with a simple interface (as simple as tapping \"confirm\" or \"reject\"), and if Internet isn&#x27;t available it should provide an ability to still perform the protocol by reading some phrases and typing in what you hear back. reply mertd 13 hours agoparentprevThis is accurate. One would expect a lot better from the fraud department of such a major bank but here we are...

Given that I was calling to set up that exact system, neither answer made sense. The agent I was speaking to was seemingly unable to comprehend this, and I got sent to a branch having failed the ID check.I went to my local branch with enough ID bearing photos and recent addresses to pass all the usual KYC&#x2F;AML checks to open a new facility at any major financial institution in my country. Having explained the situation and showed that ID to a bemused but sympathetic member of staff, they called their magic phone number to speak to the relevant team, gave their staff credentials, and confirmed that I was present in person with them and they had personally verified my ID. They were then transferred to apparently the same phone system I’d called from home myself, which got stuck at exactly the same ID check.Didn’t stay there long, though longer than the place whose “security team” called me and started the conversation with, “Good morning, I’m calling from the security team at (my bank). Before I can talk to you any further, I need to verify some personal details to confirm your identity. Can you please tell me (the top three things I’d need to know if I were an identity thief and wanted to impersonate you with other services)?” I particularly liked the anonymous phone number they were calling from. And in case anyone’s wondering, I did call the bank back at one of their public phone numbers, and they confirmed that the call I’d rejected was from them. reply dredmorbius 15 hours agorootparentprevAs much as I tend to agree with you, people who have loans, particularly mortgages, which are frequently traded amongst financial institutions, are locked in to a particular company like it or not.But for retail banking, supposing you actually have the option, yes, absolutely. reply logifail 14 hours agorootparent> people who have loans, particularly mortgages, which are frequently traded amongst financial institutions, are locked in to a particular company like it or notWhen we got the mortgage for our house, we went out of our way to arrange it with a bank with which we had (and have since had) no other dealings.Result: Our \"mortgage bank\" has no insight into our day-to-day finances.

They were highly sophisticated. They knew details of recent transactions, including bank transaction numbers that don’t show in any qif export or anything. They had a plausible reason to call (based on said visibility). They had researched my name and everything about me and my family that is online. They faked caller ID. Their ‘patter’ was so advanced that I do not know this extra layer of protection would have helped much. Luckily I didn’t finish the steps and lost no money.It is clear the bank has had a severe exfiltration event. There are other reports that online.

They called back in 15 minutes claiming to be from the bank fraud dept returning my call. Then 2 weeks later they called back claiming to be from Action Fraud.However prepared you think you are for such an attack, my advice is to have utmost caution for every single call from anyone claiming to be anyone.I also have a Monzo account.

Inevitably your parent would answer the phone because they were, for example, in the kitchen cooking your dinner.There would then be a shout across the house \"Bobby its Johnny ... AGAIN !\".The call-transfer process would involve your parent hanging up and you picking up the nearest secondary handset.Hence the exchange needed to keep the A-end of the call live whilst you completed the B-end \"transfer\".The same generation of people will also recall the ability to abuse the mechanism to quietly spy on someone else using the phone. :) reply kylegordon 16 hours agorootparentUK analogue strowger exchanges did not permit the called party to clear down the line - that was the job of the calling party.

In fact that’s how I caught the phisher as I noted the aggravation in 1% of his voice.- use credit cards, not debit cards, for purchases. They have far more protection.- use all the 2FA and password complexity you can- never use real info for challenge questions. Never use maiden name of mother etc. you can put “14 green fish” as the answer to the question if you like.- make sure they are FSCS regulated, and try not to exceed that limit.- understand FSCS does not cover you most phishing attempts, since the bank will claim they tried to warn you and were not negligent- use private tabs for bank interactionsThrough this experience I have learned not to trust “what we know about you” information they share. Do not underestimate HUMINT.

The person on the phone said \"I&#x27;ve just sent a code to your phone\". I got the text, which reads (and I quote): \"Citi ID Code: 671865. We&#x27;ll NEVER call or text for this code\".

I ended up having to run home to get my wallet and run back. The Apple rep was kind enough to let back into the store with like a minute left before it closed.This was ~6 months ago. My Citi app says my card is blocked to this day and that \"[they] need to speak urgently with me\", yet I can still make purchases with it as if it weren&#x27;t blocked.

Always use secure in-app communication. And use secure device binding + password&#x2F;pin + biometric authentication for access. Use a pre-registered and securely couriered FIDO2 token (Yubikey) + in-app video-KYC for initial setup and credential resets. Don&#x27;t depend on another channel for resetting any of the credentials. Educate the user that you will never contact them via any other means. Establish these secure expectations with the user from day-0. Within the app, always do additional factor authentication for any monetary transaction. On the server-side, have per-transaction, per-day limits for fund transfers. For large value transfers, require payees to be added to the account and have a 1-2 days cooling off period. Notify the user during this cooling-off period and give them ample opportunity to intervene if they think it is a mistake or fraud. Have low-friction instant payments only to pre-verified and registered merchant addresses. For person to person instant transfers, have velocity limits and legal framework to clawback and prosecute in case of fraud. For out-of-network (say international) instant transfers, definitely require payees to be verified and added to payer&#x27;s account and have fraud protection funds to enable swift clawback and legal frameworks for prosecution across international borders.

Yes I think it&#x27;s more secure if complemented with other good mechanisms. I agree that the current state of most voice based schemes is pretty poor. But those that involve a separate codebook can be quite tight.Like all things it&#x27;s more secure in the hands of people moderately educated in protocols and sufficiently sceptical.A general security problem, perhaps a paradox, is that the more we try to hide it for \"convenience\", the more opaque and automatic, the more people come to blindly depend on the mechanism at some other layer and stop thinking.I suppose what makes voice based interaction more secure is that it&#x27;s slower. It gives more time for levels of security in depth and for people to figure out something is amiss.But we&#x27;ll have to see how that pans out with sophisticated voice-spoofing technology because I expect most people, even well educated and sceptical ones, are easily flipped into trust mode by the sound of a seemingly familiar voice and some clever replay attacks. reply esprehn 19 hours agorootparentprevHow do you expect that to work?

I mean, why is basic source authentication not built in as far back as SS7 given we had the technology even in the 1970s?The only time you&#x27;d be using the app would be if receiving a call from an untrusted caller. And if you don&#x27;t trust the app period, then the game is off anyway. In theory the same app could hold certs from a number of \"trustworthy\" sources you might like to check; much like a TLS certificate.But in the end you&#x27;d wind up with too many, and hard to keep track of, and then buffoons like those from the EU commission would be wanting to \"force trust\" upon you to authenticate \"approved government sources\" - Which sadly is the problem with all source authentication schemes that work with PKI this way. You really need to keep the application layer relation 1-to-1.I prefer simpler, elegant solutions - like your bank should never call you or push ANYTHING which is why I called it both a good and bad idea, and generally I distrust the whole ecosystem, of \"apps\" anyway. replyd-z-m 18 hours agoprev> This blog post was accurate when we published it – head to monzo.com or your Monzo app for the most up to date information.I am on monzo.com reply FartyMcFarter 21 hours agoprevI have another idea for Monzo: never call people.You can&#x27;t rely on people being able to talk on the phone for accessibility reasons, so it should never be necessary to call people on the phone.Instead, handle things by the app or wait for customers to call you. reply simonw 20 hours agoparentFrom that article:> Remember, we will never call you without arranging it with you first through in-app chat. reply FartyMcFarter 19 hours agorootparentRight - so why not simply ask people to call them?

Obviously we have this within common chat apps, and we know there are good open source frameworks for doing this.Company calls consumer via their private company-to-app system, app alerts user of an incoming communication request, and user accepts and has a voice conversation.Then of course it becomes a question of the security quality of the app and communication design between it and the company, but presumably if that is broken then any app-based status or verification would also be broken. reply notnmeyer 17 hours agoprevthis is a cool feature!i had someone call me recently claiming to be from coinbase and try to get me to enter a password reset code into a site hosted at “w-coinbase.com”. they claimed my account was compromised and “locked” (it wasn’t).i humored the guy and asked for a help page from coinbase that listed “w-coinbase.com” as one of their official domains. they genius asked me to trust him, or i could talk to his manager who would share my ssn with me as “proof”.i talked to the guy for like an hour asking him to put himself in my shoes, or explain why i couldn’t address the issue myself with a password reset or redoing my mfa setup. he got really angry, saying i was berating him for doing his job.i suggested he give me a case number and i’d call back into coinbase’s support line. he gave me a six digit number and then hung up abruptly when i said i’d call him back.it was glorious.anyway, every one should have a feature like this. reply throwaway290 15 hours agoparentnice, Atomic Shrimp vibe! reply agilob 18 hours agoprevMonzo is bleeding edge in many things, but their customer support is making people leave this bank.

    "title": "Creating a Personal Font: From Handwriting to True Type (TTF) for Web Publishing",
    "originLink": "https://kokorobot.ca/site/making_a_font.html",
    "originBody": "Making a font 2023.11.09 This month I decided to learn how to make a font to use in my comic hakum. Previously, I was drawing the text digitally with my pen tablet. The result was fine, but sometimes difficult to read(the text would grow and shrink often in one page). I didn't want to use an existing font, so I decided to make one based on my own handwriting. A font would keep my writing legible, and consistent throughout the comic. Disclaimer: This is my first time making a font. I'm not a designer, nor do I master font creation in general or the use of the software FontForge. There are probably better ways to do what I did. This write-up is to describe my process, and can maybe help other beginners make their first font(for personal use). My aim was to make a TTF font for use in web publishing, with a limited set of characters(no bold, italics). Iterations I made two iterations of my font. The first was based on my digital handwriting(using a pen tablet), and the second was made from a scanned image of my handwriting. The second iteration of the font was more natural because on paper my writing is less precise, more organic. I learned a lot about fonts while making my own, namely the terms listed below which describe all parts of a typeface. Knowing these terms and their function can help you make better design choices, and will ensure that you draw a functional font. The typeface anatomy Ascender: The portion of a minuscule letter that extends above the mean line of a font. That is, the part of a lower-case letter that is taller than the font's x-height. Baseline: The line upon which most letters sit and below which descenders extend. Cap Height: A line representing the height of most capital letters. Descender: The portion of a letter that extends below the baseline of a font (ex: p and q). X-Height: The distance between the baseline and the mean line of lowercase letters in a typeface. For my handwritten font I focused on the uppercase(A-Z) and lowercase(a-z) glyphs, numbers(0-9), and glyphs for basic punctuation(comma, exclamation mark, question mark, etc). In my sketchbook, I drew reference lines for the baseline, the cap height, x-height, and for the descender in pencil. I didn't make the characters large, nor did I put extra care in drawing them. The characters turned out okay, but drawing between the reference lines made them too stiff. I instead wrote the phrase \"The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox\" a bunch of times in both uppercase and lowercase letters, which features all of the characters needed for a font(a-z). My letters come out better when writing a sentence, when I'm not thinking about the lettering too much. When trying to draw on a grid all I think about are the constraints. I picked out the best-written sentence and used that to make the font(ended up using some I'd drawn on the grid too). Doing it this way means that I later had to fix the cap-height, x-height, and descender of each character digitally so they'd match up. After scanning my letters, I applied a threshold(Color > Threshold in Gimp) to the image to remove all grays. Then because of the nature of pencil on paper, and because I didn't use a grid, I spent time fixing some of the imperfections in the letters using the pencil tool in Gimp(with all dynamics turned off in Tool Options to get clean lines). I copy/pasted all of the cleaned-up letters in a new Gimp document(see image above) with a height and width that could accommodate the tallest and widest letter: capital M. This is a good time to double-check the weight of all of the lines, if the thickness varies too much it may not look good. I exported all of the letters individually as PNGs in my project folder. FontForge I chose FontForge to create my font because I knew it worked on Linux, and because people I knew vouched for it(not because it is the best of the best). I still don't know if it's the 'best of the best' but I did like using it. After creating a project in FontForge, a window appears. This is the Font View Window, it shows a table of all the glyphs in the font. At this point all of the slots are empty. To start, select Element>Font Info to fill out the font information. Under PS Names, add your font name. If your goal is to export as a TTF, in that same window go to General, and change the Em size to 1024. In TrueType fonts, the UPM(Units per Em) is by convention a power of two, generally set to 1024 or 2048. OTF fonts have different requirements. Note: Back when print letters were cast in metal blocks, each letter was fitted into its own space container to ensure that the height of each letter was uniform. The height of a type piece is known as the ‘em’, and it originates from the width of the uppercase ‘M’ character. Double-clicking a glyph in the Font View opens it in the Character View. This is where you can draw and edit glyphs, either one at a time with a tab interface, or side by side with a prepared text file of words to step through. On the bottom left, there is a box displaying 3 layers. Select the Back layer in the lower left menu, go to File > Import to import the PNG glyph for the letter X. The glyph reference will appear on the canvas. Helpful shortcuts: z to zoom in, x to zoom out. At this point, you can choose to delineate the glyph yourself (see the Font Forge tutorial on drawing), or you can use Autotrace(to do this, select the Fore layer, and go to Select > Autotrace). Autotrace will use the background image as a reference and will recreate it as an outline, complete with control points and bézier curves. Although it can be a bit messy(too many points), and cause missing extrema issues(the extreme part of any curve). Once you have a closed shape, the glyph will appear in the other window. At this point, I like to adjust the space on the left and right side of a glyph by adjusting the left and right side bearings(this determines how wide the final glyph will be). If you want to auto-center all of the glyphs at once, go to Metrics > Auto Width. If you want all the glyphs to be centered, Metrics > Center In Width. If fixing the outline of a glyph, it helps to turn the reference layer off(uncheck it). If you wish to start over with a glyph, go to the Font Window and select the desired glyph, then in that same window go to Edit > Clear. To remove the reference layer select Edit > Clear Background. TIP. In the Character View, there's a text field above the working canvas featuring the letter that is being worked on. When clicking in the text field, square brackets will appear around the character. Typing words, or random letters after the last square bracket gives a preview of what they look like next to each other (thank you Lizbeth for this great tip!). Repeat this procedure for all of the glyphs. A very quick way to describe a very long process. Don't forget to adjust the left and right side bearings for the Space glyph, if you don't your font will have too much space between words. Kerning Kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a font so it is pleasant to read. In the Font Window, go to Element > Font Info, Lookups, click on the GPOS tab, and click on Add Lookup. In the Type dropdown menu, select Pair Position (Kerning). In the Feature column, click on the down arrow next to New, select Kern Horizontal Kerning, and click OK. Select the newly-created entry in the GPOS tab, and click on Add Subtable(right hand side). Leave the name as is, and click OK. In this menu, leave the settings as they are and drag-select all of the letters you want to kern in both tables. Be sure to select both the upper and lower case letters. To select both sets in a table press shift. When you're done, press OK. Click on pairings. A magnified version of the glyph pairings will appear in the bottom half of the window. You can drag the second glyph and bring it closer or farther to the first glyph. Do this to all of the glyphs to make sure that they appear well together. Font testing You can test the font and kerning in FontForge. Go to File > Print. In this view you'll see how your font looks. The default text doesn't show all possible pairing, but it's possible to add your own text. See the document kern_pairings.txt which has all of the kern pairings (this is what I pasted in the above screenshot). Problems with exporting the font Go to File > Generate Fonts. At this point FontForge may hold certain characters for review, you may encounter issues like: Non-integral coordinates Missing points at extrema Self intersecting Non-integral coordinates. A non-integral coordinate is one(or many) points in the outline of a glyph with a number(its position) that has a fractional component (ex: 2.25). To fix non-integral coordinates in a glyph, select the problematic glyph, go to Element > Validation > Find Problems, check the box for \"non-integral coordinates\", click OK, and press fix until it stops. In a handwritten font which typically doesn't rely too much on precision(depends, but for the most part), a point that is moved to a new coordinate that is very near(and non-fractional) will not be too dramatic. Missing points at extrema. Extrema are the most extreme points in a curve. When FF calls for \"missing points at extrema\", it means that a curve's control points are pushing the curve out past the edge. The peak of the curve must be a (yellow)point. Play with the control points to get the extreme part of the curve to become a yellow circle. Element > Add Extrema can help solve the problem, but it may distort the glyph or create more issues with non-integral coordinates. It's still possible to generate a font even if this error appears in the log(that's what I did), but it may create some annoying subtle distortions in the font. Extrema issues may happen with a handwritten font that is a bit messy(especially if Autotrace is used). Self intersecting. Self intersecting means that the outline of the glyph is somehow overlapping itself. Check all of the lines to remove the overlap. Choosing a font type For my use, a TTF(true type font) is enough. Choosing something like OTF is unnecessary because I don't plan on storing many glyphs (I don't specifically want a bold or italic font, and if I ever do I can make it a separate font), nor do I need ligatures. The content the font will be used for is published on the web, and TTF is excellent for that. To generate a font from all of the glyphs in the Font View, go to File > Generate Fonts. In the dropdown menu below your chosen font name, choose the output font TTF(True Type). Select OK. The font will be saved in the project folder. Move the font to where fonts are stored on your system. Read the FontForge documentation. To learn how to install fonts on Linux, see my My spellbook. See the font in use in night terror.",

    "originBody": "BurntSushi / ripgrep Public Notifications Fork 1.8k Star 41.3k Code Issues 72 Pull requests Discussions Actions Security Insights Releases 14.0.0 14.0.0 Compare github-actions released this · 8 commits to master since this release 14.0.0 93429d0 Sponsorship is appreciated! ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new features, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes. In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. The headlining feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release, they are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future. To enable them, try passing --hyperlink-format default. If you use VS Code, then try passing --hyperlink-format vscode. Please report your experience with hyperlinks, positive or negative. Another headlining development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of its regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some searches may get faster. You can read more about the regex engine rewrite on my blog. Please report your performance improvements or regressions that you notice. Finally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users should not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed somewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example, things like --no-ignore --ignore-vcs work as one would expect (disables all filtering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control systems such as git). BREAKING CHANGES: rg -C1 -A2 used to be equivalent to rg -A2, but now it is equivalent to rg -B1 -A2. That is, -A and -B no longer completely override -C. Instead, they only partially override -C. Build process changes: ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep with a new --generate flag. For example, rg --generate man will write a man page in roff format on stdout. The release archives have not changed. The optional build dependency on asciidoc or asciidoctor has been dropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now owns this process itself by writing roff directly. Performance improvements: PERF #1746: Make some cases with inner literals faster. PERF #1760: Make most searches with \\b look-arounds (among others) much faster. PERF #2591: Parallel directory traversal now uses work stealing for faster searches. PERF #2642: Parallel directory traversal has some contention reduced. Feature enhancements: Added or improved file type filtering for Ada, DITA, Elixir, Fuchsia, Gentoo, Gradle, GraphQL, Markdown, Prolog, Raku, TypeScript, USD, V FEATURE #665: Add a new --hyperlink-format flag that turns file paths into hyperlinks. FEATURE #1709: Improve documentation of ripgrep's behavior when stdout is a tty. FEATURE #1737: Provide binaries for Apple silicon. FEATURE #1790: Add new --stop-on-nonmatch flag. FEATURE #1814: Flags are now categorized in -h/--help output and ripgrep's man page. FEATURE #1838: An error is shown when searching for NUL bytes with binary detection enabled. FEATURE #2195: When extra-verbose mode is enabled in zsh, show extra file type info. FEATURE #2298: Add instructions for installing ripgrep using cargo binstall. FEATURE #2409: Added installation instructions for winget. FEATURE #2425: Shell completions (and man page) can be created via rg --generate.

You can use $ sign + upper case letters as wildcard, e.g. $MATCH, to match any single AST node. Think it as REGEX dot ., except it is not textual. reply wwarner 7 hours agoparentprevThis use case is a killer feature of emacs.

It shows relevant code from every layer of the AST, above and below the matches.It feels quite useful when you&#x27;re grepping to understand how functions, classes, variables etc are used within a non-trivial codebase.Here&#x27;s a snippet that shows grep-ast searching the django repo. Notice that it finds `ROOT_URLCONF` and then shows you the method and class that contain the matching line, including a helpful part of the docstring. If you ran this in the terminal, it would also colorize the matches. django$ gast ROOT_URLCONF middleware&#x2F;locale.py: │from django.conf import settings │from django.conf.urls.i18n import is_language_prefix_patterns_used │from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect ⋮... │class LocaleMiddleware(MiddlewareMixin): │ \"\"\" │ Parse a request and decide what translation object to install in the │ current thread context.

There are definitely a few tools that have explored the idea of searching the AST of code. Semgrep seems to do that, as does a tool called ast-grep [0].Both of them are sort of doing the opposite of my tool.

    "originBody": "November 13, 2023 Editors' notes This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies. Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread Hunter-gatherer approach to childcare suggests that the key to mother and child well-being may be many caregivers by University of Cambridge A Mbendjele camp in the Congo rainforest. Credit: Dr Nikhil Chaudhary Infants and toddlers may be psychologically wired to thrive with high levels of \"sensitive care\" and personal attention, according to a study conducted with contemporary hunter-gatherer societies. Research led by an evolutionary anthropologist at Cambridge University found that hunter-gatherer infants receive attentive care and physical contact for about nine hours per day from up to 15 different caregivers. Dr. Nikhil Chaudhary says that, for the vast majority of our species' evolutionary history, mothers probably had far more support than they currently do in Western countries such as the UK. He argues that recent changes in UK policy show childcare is becoming more of a priority for the government, which is a step forward, but more needs to be done to ensure the well-being of mothers and children. \"For more than 95% of our evolutionary history we lived as hunter-gatherers. Therefore, contemporary hunter-gatherer societies can offer clues as to whether there are certain child-rearing systems to which infants, and their mothers, may be psychologically adapted,\" said Chaudhary. However, caution should be exercised before jumping to conclusions, argues Chaudhary., \"Many aspects of our psychology have evolved to be flexible rather than best suited to one specific way of life . The extent to which this is true for childrearing is still debated.\" For the latest research, Dr. Chaudhary and his colleague Dr. Salali worked with Mbendjele BaYaka hunter-gatherers who reside in the Republic of Congo, and have been analyzing and interpreting the findings alongside a child psychiatrist, Dr. Annie Swanepoel. In the new paper, published in Developmental Psychology, the researchers say that children may be \"evolutionarily primed\" to expect exceptionally high levels of physical contact and care, as well as personal attention from several caregivers in addition to their biological parents. When considering the implications for Western countries, the authors highlight that the provision of affordable high-quality childcare support, which goes beyond effective supervision, should be prioritized. Higher caregiver-to-child ratios, and stability of key caregivers in nurseries and institutional care, may be important for minimizing risks to well-being. In the observed hunter-gatherer communities, caregiving goes so far beyond the parents, according to the researchers. Children often have 10+ caregivers and occasionally 20 or more, and typically a mother's support system would help respond to more than half of her baby's episodes of crying, which can be one of the most challenging aspects of parenting. \"Support for mothers also has numerous benefits for children such as reducing the risk of neglect and abuse, buffering against family adversity, and improving maternal well-being which in turn enhances maternal care,\" said Dr. Swanepoel. The study found that it was common for older children and adolescents to be heavily involved in caring for infants, further supporting mothers and giving these young caregivers valuable experience. The researchers speculate that this might boost their confidence as caregivers, and perhaps offer some protection against the anxieties often experienced by first time parents. The authors also point out that in Western societies it is common for childcare to be used simply to allow parents to work, but insist that childcare needs to give parents an actual break. They argue that throughout human history and prehistory, parents have never been under the pressure they are now in terms of lack of support. \"The nuclear family system in the west is a world away from the communal living arrangements of hunter-gatherer societies like the Mbendjele,\" said Chaudhary. He says that changes in UK childcare policy, such as expanding free childcare to include younger children, are an important step. However, both of these schemes are only available for working families and further contribute to childcare only being available for parents to fill the 'freed' time with work, rather than rest. Ratios of caregivers to children were greater than five-to-one in the observed hunter-gatherer groups, whereas in UK nurseries each adult is responsible for numerous children. In fact, regulations on adult-to-child ratios in early years settings have recently decreased for two-year-olds to one caregiver for five children—the opposite of what the researchers observed in the Mbendjele communities. Despite the high numbers of caregivers, the study suggests that children may be adapted to have a stable set of a core caregivers within this larger network. Mbendjele children benefit from the supplementary care of many people, but retain access to personal attention and consistency from a handful of key caregivers. This is in line with previous research suggesting a potential link between instability of caregivers and issues with emotional and cognitive development, says Chaudhary, who is concerned that many childcare and education settings in the UK currently face a staffing crisis, and rely on ever-changing agency staff. \"Childcare is finally becoming a priority in the government's budget, but there is much more to do,\" Chaudhary added. \"As a society, from policy makers to employers to health care services, we need to work together to ensure mothers and children receive the support and care they need to thrive.\" More information: Sensitive Responsiveness and Multiple Caregiving Networks Among Mbendjele BaYaka Hunter-Gatherers: Potential Implications for Psychological Development and Well-Being, Developmental Psychology (2023).

I&#x27;ll add some context below in case you&#x27;re interested in hearing about my own perspective.I was pretty darn happy as someone who got to go read a book each weekend at a coffee shop and workout 3x per week. I eventually had a kid and I no longer have hardly any time for the stuff I used to love to do. Kids need constant assistance and have their own growing pains. Despite all that, it&#x27;s given me a richness and depth to my life that I can&#x27;t put into words. I get to experience raising someone with all the ups and downs. This has given me a kind of wisdom I never knew I didn&#x27;t have. I could go on and on for days.\"A lie parents tell themselves to justify their decision\"? Not at all (at least for 99% of is I&#x27;d wager). It&#x27;s terrifying, but I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.

I had a kid and never particularly found the richness and depth emotional feeling.Of course if you express the opinion you find parenting to be basically another duty you must fulfill to the best of your ability despite finding little to no joy from the task, it will be taken poorly. So you internalize the lie, buy into it the best you can to pretend to yourself you don&#x27;t have an opinion that makes everyone hate you, because apparently parenting is the one duty that is &#x27;wrong&#x27; unless you find it satisfying.Feels like a bunch of people got the &#x27;dope&#x27; that makes parents feel emotional rewarded from the insane amount of labor it requires, others internalize the &#x27;lie&#x27; so they have a way to respond to others in a socially appropriate way. reply berniebb 1 hour agorootparentI feel in anything you do or have to do, you can find richness and depth. At least that’s somehow what I like to believe and trying to make my life experience be by practicing meditation.The duty of being a parent however, just comes with so much expectations from society and therefore within yourself - It is super hard to find freedom within that duty, to then actually find your relationship to your child, the specific richness and depth it can be for the both of you.So in that regard, saying „I don’t find that in there for me“ is just as good and right as any other point of experience. reply em-bee 5 hours agorootparentprevactually, i believe this experience is more common for fathers at least than people want to admit. especially in western society fathers are generally expected to be more involved, and have a hard time when they come from a family where this wasn&#x27;t the case (so they don&#x27;t have a good role model) nor have a partner that encourages them to be involved, or worse a partner that actually discourages them.i have been struggling with this too, especially because i had quite different expectations going in.but the thing is that what gives you joy very much depends on your own expectations, and you can change those. i believe it&#x27;s the same thing as with a job. there are people arguing that you should love your job, and if you don&#x27;t you should not be doing it, while others claim that most people don&#x27;t have a choice but to take a job that they don&#x27;t enjoy.finding that joy may just take some searching. reply salamandersss 5 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t find joy.

(like i enjoy playing with the kids, but i don&#x27;t enjoy not having much time to do so)i think the primary problem is expectations of others. i may be lucky, that i do have a supportive family and partner that do not push any specific expectations on me, so i am free to find the enjoyment where i like. and a strong part of that for me is that i enjoy that i have been given this responsibility and am able to take care of my family to the best of my ability. in other words: i wanted this life and i am thankful to have gotten it, even if it turned out different than i thought it would be. reply salamandersss 3 hours agorootparentYour opinion is perfectly valid.The main expectations I am driven by are to provide the child with adequate resources to thrive, to not neglect the child, and to give them a good footing to navigate this life. I&#x27;m not sure if these are expectations that can reasonably be relaxed, I&#x27;m just pretty much resigned I&#x27;m in for a long slog to provide these for the good of the child at great effort to myself whether it pleases me or not -- the circle of life I guess. replyAuryGlenz 2 hours agorootparentprevOther people have put it more eloquently and perhaps a bit more diplomatically, but you’re wrong.I lived for 33 years before having a child and nothing - absolutely nothing - ever brought me more joy than something as simple as my daughter’s stupid grin when I’m on my back and she’s above me, ready to pounce.While I’m sure not every parent feels the same way, I bet most do.

It’s not like he’s a good, upstanding role model for the kid. So I think it’s pretty clear here that, whichever one it is, [nature or nurture], there’s some combination of both. I obviously don’t believe in eugenics. I think you could look at it both ways—you have this couple that’s trying to be so responsible that they end up never having kids.

Love toward children is dominated by the hard work of charity. The aim is to guide a human being into adulthood for that other person&#x27;s sake, for the sake of their true end, not for ourselves (hence the self-centeredness of thinking one is entitled to having children, resorting to all sorts of immoral technologies to have them). Disinterested charity, of course, has the effect of actualizing us as people, and nothing is as actualizing as parenthood, as that is our essential identity (one that can be exercised in surrogate ways, of course).> babies might have evolved to be more and more dependent, because having more and more invested caregivers produces fitter offspring.The major reason human beings require more investment is intelligence. Many species are born or hatched ready to go, and perhaps never meet their parents. Some require only a relatively short period of parental support. But human beings must go through a long period of formation. Intelligence is also the reason why we lack all sorts of anatomical features that other animals have. Why? Because intelligence allows us to pursue all sorts of ends, while other animals are quite limited in this regard.

So a break does not necessarily mean not working. But I believe there are a lot of demanding jobs that are not a break from childcare.The other aspect I can relate to is the fact that in hunter-gatherer communities many different caregivers support each other. Every summer we travel in the mountains with 3-4 other families and their kids. Last year there where 12 kids under the age of 8. Sounds very stressful but actually it was really smooth. Having multiple parents available all the time allowed everyone to take a real break once in a while.

American black culture is often derided as being inadequate, particularly in efforts to raise well-adjusted and pro-social children, but what&#x27;s rarely mentioned by these commenters is how frequent and widespread are the historical and contemporary destruction and dissolution of black communities in America. In the too-common case of single mothers rearing children alone (the absence of the father often itself a product of poor social support), the difference seems to be in the presence or absence of older siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and supportive teachers, especially when the mother is forced to work multiple jobs in order to cover ever-increasing expenses. (It should also be noted that when the father is present, married or not, he tends to spend more time with his children than fathers of other ethnicities.)I bring this up in order to maybe open some minds as to why we see racial disparities of certain types - and also because, as mentioned by another commenter, the increasing atomization of families and communities of other ethnic groups threatens to replicate the aforementioned dysfunction.

As someone who has been neglected by his parents very early in life, and been given to be taken care of by various family members&#x2F;friends&#x2F;institutions I cannot wish this for anyone. You will forever wear a feeling of abandonment and insecurity that is unfixable. That someone seriously pushes this as a valid method for raising kids is beyond ridiculous and just shows how disconnected from reality modern \"researcher\" can be.It also entirely removes the principle of responsibility in reproduction. We are conscientious animals and we have a responsibility to not reproduce if it is suboptimal to do so. The problems we face right now as a species are precisely because we created a system that removed many of the problems preventing too large reproduction but without also enforcing full responsibility (without the modern support system the sentence would be death).I get pissed off at all of this nonsense modern take. We had a system; it was working pretty well. In fact, it successfully kickstarted the industrial revolution and continued until relatively recently. Then feminism happened and suddenly nothing works. Women are the only one biologically able to create new humans and they have all the necessary toolkit to grow them to maturity; up to the point they are ready and stable as humans to be able to learn and collaborate with others.

These ratios can only happen due to a social structure that involves large extended families and a social structure that has a large proportion of the population (pretty much all the females) that spend all their time with each other and the children.However, that would be a huge step backwards from the progress we have made in women’s rights and equality. reply cycomanic 13 hours agoparentI find that part of the article and the parallels drawn to nurseries in the UK (by one of the researchers apparently) quite weird. My understanding is that what is denoted caregiver in the article is quite different to a careperson in a nursery.I don&#x27;t think that a caregiver in the hunter gatherer society will exclusively watch one child only (and not all the time). I suspect more that they are available if needed.If we look at the scientific article, it studied 18 children across 3 camps and the camps of 20-80 individuals. The article says children had often 10-20 caregivers, based on the 18 children that&#x27;s a minimum of 180 adults. Assuming an average camp size of 50 that would mean more adults than living in the 3 camps.So clearly caregivers are not exclusive which makes the whole comparison to child to adult ratio completely non-sensical IMO and I&#x27;m quite disappointed that researcher was tempted to make a comment in this way (to be fair, often journalists try to pull out a political angle in stories, in our communication training as researchers we were actually warned to be vary of this). reply em-bee 6 hours agorootparentThe article says children had often 10-20 caregivers, based on the 18 children that&#x27;s a minimum of 180 adults.i do not understand how you could even come up with that kind of interpretation. that caregivers are not exclusive in such a scenario should be obvious. how could it be any different? and no, it doesn&#x27;t make the whole thing nonsensical. there is a qualitative difference when a child has many adult role models to choose from. it helps put the experience with their own parents in relation to how they experience other adults.the point is not the absolute ratio of adults to children, but the number of adults each child has access to that they can learn something from. and that doesn&#x27;t require any exclusivity. reply cycomanic 1 hour agorootparentI agree that the caregivers are not exclusive should be quite obvious, and yes having a lot of caregivers at different times would give the child a lot of rolemodels to choose from. The part I take issue with is:> Ratios of caregivers to children were greater than five-to-one in the observed hunter-gatherer groups, whereas in UK nurseries each adult is responsible for numerous children. In fact, regulations on adult-to-child ratios in early years settings have recently decreased for two-year-olds to one caregiver for five children—the opposite of what the researchers observed in the Mbendjele communities.That is nonsensical. There is at best a very weak correlation between the adult-to-child ratios in nurseries and how many overall caregivers a child has and the ratio of children to one adult in a nursery is certainly not \"the opposite\" of the ratio of 5 \"non-exclusive\" adults to one child in the Mbendjele communities.In fact it&#x27;s quite conceivable that even in the Mbendjele communities for parts of the day 10 children might only be looked after by 2 adults, the same ratio as UK nurseries. reply morsch 20 hours agoparentprev>> Ratios of caregivers to children were greater than five-to-one in the observed hunter-gatherer groups, whereas in UK nurseries each adult is responsible for numerous children.> There is now way you can pay for these kind of ratios.As it turns out, 5:1 is the legal limit for pre-k (age < 3) daycares in most of Germany, and the average in 2020 was 4.1:1.

Kids aren&#x27;t overmedicated by amphetamines. Teens aren&#x27;t depressed due to tiktok or angry due to drill music. Middle aged women aren&#x27;t on antideprssants. Men aren&#x27;t on opiates. Elderly parents aren&#x27;t in nursing homes being drugged up. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a utopia but the capitalist system has gone in a very bad direction, arguably worse than U",

All the ease-of-use of Pulse without any of its issues. reply odiroot 12 hours agoparentFor me the most awesome part is support for both consumer audio and pro audio profiles at the same time. No messing about with JACK etc.Everything just works. It might not be as perfect as JACK (getting some rare xruns) but it&#x27;s just so convenient! reply forevernoob 10 hours agoparentprevI hope the pro audio side gets a bit more love. I&#x27;ve installed PW for the first time on my Ubuntu 22.04 (through https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipewire-debian.github.io&#x2F;pipewire-debian&#x2F;) and so far have been experiencing high CPU usage on Bitwig Studio v5.0.11 when trying to send audio from and to my Native Instruments Komplete Audio 6, and I have no idea what the culprit might be.I&#x27;m going to try a bunch of stuff and hopefully be able to take advantage of this wonderful technology (that has already come _so_ far!)I should probably document my troubleshooting ventures. Does anyone know a nice hosted blog that supports Markdown &#x2F; CommonMark and RSS syndication? Is Substack a good option? reply viraptor 10 hours agorootparent> and I have no idea what the culprit might be.I&#x27;d start with checking all sinks&#x2F;sources to make sure you&#x27;re not resampling by accident. But even that shouldn&#x27;t be causing high CPU by itself. There&#x27;s pw-top&#x2F;pw-profiler to help you. reply forevernoob 9 hours agorootparentThanks for the pw-profiler recommendation, wasn&#x27;t aware of that one.I believe the Pro Audio profile [0] (which I&#x27;m using) doesn&#x27;t resample by default.Using pw-top, I noticed that something was causing xruns [1] (see ERR column) though I was unsure what that was. Since the Pro Audio profile uses the IRQ mechanism, I looked at interrupts [2] but couldn&#x27;t spot anything unusual. There is however irq&#x2F;16-mmc0 process which is at times causing significant (>50%) CPU usage, so I think I need to unload the sdcard module and see if that fixes anything.First however I think I&#x27;ll try a newer kernel (linux-lowlatency-hwe-22.04, which according to apt search is on 6.2.0.1017.17~22.04.14 as opposed to the current 5.15.0-89-lowlatency that ships with Ubuntu 22.04)0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;pipewire&#x2F;pipewire&#x2F;-&#x2F;wikis&#x2F;FAQ...1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paste.debian.net&#x2F;1298908&#x2F;2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paste.debian.net&#x2F;1298905&#x2F; reply justaj 6 hours agorootparentWhen reading posts like these, I sometimes I feel very lucky having a MacOS M1 setup that does what it&#x27;s supposed to and which works almost seamlessly with external hardware. Best of luck to your venture. reply viraptor 6 hours agorootparentI think that&#x27;s skipping some context though. Don&#x27;t know about the previous poster, but I&#x27;m using pipewire for things that MacOS just can&#x27;t do, at latencies which MacOS can&#x27;t pull off, with codecs that MacOS can&#x27;t support. So although I spent an hour or so on the setup &#x2F; resolving issues, that&#x27;s still 100% better.Yeah, the basic things just work on MacOS. But try to do fancy audio routing, low latency processing and other things and you&#x27;re left with spending hundreds of dollars on apps that give you half a hacky solution. reply vetinari 15 minutes agorootparent> Yeah, the basic things just work on MacOS. But try to do fancy audio routing, low latency processing and other things and you&#x27;re left with spending hundreds of dollars on apps that give you half a hacky solution.This; and that also includes running macOS version a release, two or three behind, because the newer ones break your setup. replyforevernoob 6 hours agorootparentprevCan&#x27;t edit my post, but I think I&#x27;ve found a place that fits my requirements: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forevernoob.hashnode.dev&#x2F;the-beginning - In any case I&#x27;ll try to update as I go. reply rendaw 7 hours agoparentprevI ran into a bunch of issues with it on a headless userless system. Unfortunately, like pulse, it&#x27;s deeply integrated with dbus&#x2F;policykit&#x2F;xdg stuff. Wireplumber was looking for XDG_HOME_DIR and breaking when it couldn&#x27;t find one, dbus issues when doing things from root services, Jack clients couldn&#x27;t connect, etc.I&#x27;m prepared to like it better than pulse, and alsa has its warts, but I&#x27;m not 100% convinced yet. reply jauntywundrkind 13 hours agoparentprevThat pipe wire can often meet or beat pro-audio JACK for latency is so elegant & nice. Defeating that compromise of PulseAudio seems like the crowning achievement to me; there&#x27;s not a lot of other faults or defects I felt with PulseAudio, and I say this as someone who has had sound servers with half a dozen audio cards (mostly USB) I&#x27;ve run off a system, as someone who has streamed PulseAudio from one system to another.The technical sophistication of PipeWire is almost purely made possible by Linux improving, by the availability of DMA-BUFs for shared memory inter-process work. This wasn&#x27;t possible when PulseAudio (nee Polyp) was being created; the kernel couldn&#x27;t do that then.On top of this modern base, pipewire has done a fantastic job generalizing it&#x27;s architecture. It&#x27;s also designed to pipe video. It could conceivably be used to pipe input events, or other arbitrary streams too. This is a cool upgrade that I hope we see more leaning into over time; I hope PipeWire someday becomes so pervasively used for so many reasons that it is even more known, tapped, used, & loved that dbus, the current inter-process nexus of FreeDesktop. reply ahartmetz 13 hours agorootparent> The technical sophistication of PipeWire is almost purely made possible by Linux improvingI&#x27;m not sure about that. I guess improvements in ALSA have contributed. But PipeWire was created by none other than the guy who rearchitected GStreamer&#x27;s foundations after GStreamer had been brittle and prone to crashing for years. I don&#x27;t think that there was a better person in the Linux ecosystem to do it. It&#x27;s the second system effect without featuritis, like when some of the Unix people created Plan 9.Personally, I was not happy with PulseAudio, and I&#x27;m very happy with PipeWire. Great, great stuff.I say that as both a user and somebody who created a prototype for a sound system for an embedded platform on top of PulseAudio that was, AFAICT, abandoned because it just couldn&#x27;t deliver some things. PipeWire was on the radar at the time but too much in its infancy to use back then. That stopped being the case years ago. reply fiddlerwoaroof 12 hours agorootparentI’ve had nothing but issues with PulseAudio, leading me to disable it and use plain ALSA (with dmix) on basically every Linux system I’ve used. I’m excited that it’s being replaced, but I no longer use desktop Linux very often. reply jauntywundrkind 9 hours agorootparentprevI love this paean, and I am delighted to assimilate this gleeful happy memetics into my own. But I think the hate sucks & can get lost. Maybe it&#x27;s not hate, but I&#x27;m just so done, so fed up with intolerance and&#x2F;or nattering against Lennart Poettering, and it all comes off as ridiculous to me. Whatever the qualms: Pulseaudio and systemd have been such vast giant leaps over where we were before. Most of the voices are just against. That is, they don&#x27;t saying what else we ought have done, they dont speculate constructively. They&#x27;re winges (thank you Ben Collins for re-introducing me to that word). It would be such a bleaker worse world without pulseaudio and without systemd. (I&#x27;m sorry to hear your product ran into such difficulty though!)I absolutely am happy to hand a massive trophy to Wim Taymans for building a truly elegant API architecture. But I repeat again: the core of PipeWire would not have been possible without the better Linux we have today. PipeWire competes with JACK because of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pipewire.org&#x2F;page_dma_buf.html . That&#x27;s basically a fact. reply GloomyBoots 13 hours agoprevI don’t have anything bad to say about PipeWire. It&#x27;s really been a breath of fresh air. And, as much hate as it gets, so was PulseAudio when it came out. Good to see things moving forward. reply zlg_codes 11 hours agoparentPulseAudio got hate because of the trouble it caused. PipeWire seems less likely to create gigabytes of logging without reporting issues.There are reasons that things get opposed. It isn&#x27;t just some irrational juju feeling. reply ric2b 12 hours agoparentprevI did have some Bluetooth issues that made my headset unusable if I was using a Bluetooth mouse at the same time, but that issue seems to have resolved itself a few weeks ago so now I don&#x27;t have any complaints either. reply vonjuice 11 hours agorootparentI had issues with audio production, but not anymore. I think this \"not anymore\" is the key takeaway. It may or may not be ready for everyone right now but it keeps improving. reply lupusreal 14 hours agoprevMuch love for Pipewire for bringing \"just werks\" audio to the Linux desktop. reply patrakov 2 hours agoparentIt \"just works\" in the default configuration on traditional hardware, where plugging the headphones in does not result in the need to move streams to a \"different\" sound card. I have slightly unusual hardware in the form of a Dell Inspiron 7415 laptop (with its internal microphone and the headset microphone presented as two separate SOF cards), and there are two trouble points:* The external microphone level is not saved&#x2F;restored across the reboot, making the other party complain that my voice is clipping* The echo canceller configuration is static - once loaded, it does not react to the headset plug&#x2F;unplug events and always uses the same microphone. reply dither8 13 hours agoprevPipewire for the first time got Pulse and JACK to work together for me. Bravo. reply sroerick 12 hours agoprev10 or so years ago I spent a long time customizing a DAW workstation on Arch using JACK and Ardour and a lot of other utilities.It had a steep learning curve and a lot of configuration but I loved the freedom JACK granted to wire applications to each other.Is anybody using PipeWire in an audio engineering setup? Or would JACK still be the preferred method here? reply vonjuice 11 hours agoparentI was using JACK and tried switching to PW at various points and always encountered issues.Last year I took another chance and made a fresh Arch install on my laptop and went with PW (on previous attempts I tried to switch on an already running system). I had no issues, and in fact it solved some issues I used to have on jack.Then I did the same on my desktop. I had problems setting up my microphone, but I managed to solve it. Now I have two, very minor issues: sometimes bitwig takes a bit to start the audio engine, or I have to restart the program; and sometimes my audio stops working when I unplug my zoom h1n while the system is running. I rarely do the latter so it&#x27;s barely an issue. reply tcrenshaw 6 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m currently in the process of setting up pipewire in an audio engineering setting. Currently in the process of latency tuning, hovering around 9ms right now, would love to cut that in half.I&#x27;m using ardour (after the creator recommended I try it in another HN thread) on Debian with a realtime kernel for a 16 in by 8 out interface for eventual use as a FOH mixing console.After lots of tweaking, I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement over the default pipewire-jack config, but I&#x27;ve only recently started tackling realtime priorities and modifying pipewire metadata for interfaces. reply jampekka 11 hours agoparentprevThere are patchbays for PipeWire that allow for wiring like jack. qpwgraph seems to be the most functional. Can use pw-cli too.Actually it allows wiring also jack applications to pipewire applications and pipewire to jack. I use e.g. \"pw-jack ardour\" to run ardour and launch pw-jack jconvolver and route inputs and outputs with qpwgraph. reply shmerl 14 hours agoprevGood milestone. Switching to PulseAudio over Pipewire from stock PulseAudio fixed audio issues in Cyberpunk 2077 for me. reply egamirorrim 14 hours agoprevShame my strix soar soundcard just stopped working when I switched to Ubuntu 23.10&#x2F;pipewireDoesn&#x27;t feel like a worth successor to pulse audio from here! reply shmerl 14 hours agoparentJust a guess, but Ubuntu might ship outdated pipewire packages. reply ric2b 12 hours agorootparentOn 23.10 they use pipewire 0.3.79 which I think is the latest stable release before this brand new 1.0 release. reply imp0cat 13 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d wait till the next LTS. reply zlg_codes 11 hours agoprevI&#x27;ll wait for software that&#x27;s not built for Red Hat&#x2F;IBM&#x2F;GNOME, thanks.XDG has gone off the rails with &#x27;portals&#x27; and other needless obfuscation of their desktop stack.If I had the financial security I&#x27;d write better alternatives, meant for communities instead of whatever Red Hat wants. reply mrlonglong 14 hours agoprev [–] It&#x27;s such a massive relief to be using something that wasn&#x27;t written by Poettering. PulseAudio was a train wreck when it was first released. Others took it over and got it working. Now with pipewire, it does things a lot better than PulseAudio ever did. reply ric2b 12 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s quite sad that one person can get this level of hate online just for releasing open source software.If you don&#x27;t like his software why are you using it? If it&#x27;s because your distro uses it shouldn&#x27;t you try to be convincing them to switch to your preferred alternative, instead of calling out the developer by name on public forums? reply jampekka 10 hours agorootparentTBF Poettering was working for RedHat when doing pulseaudio and systemd. Without RedHat they probably wouldn&#x27;t have been so widely adopted.I didn&#x27;t mind PulseAudio that much. Linux audio was a mess way before PA and PA at least works quite well for basic desktop sound. PipeWire works better and works also for DAW usage.Systemd OTOH makes almost all possible sins against the unix philosophy and it being so fundamental piece, it leaks the anti-unix all over. RedHat pushed it so deeply e.g. in Gnome that everybody eventually had to adopt it. reply pkkm 7 hours agorootparent> Systemd OTOH makes almost all possible sins against the unix philosophyIs this supposed to be a bad thing? Because I don&#x27;t find it obvious. In fact, I don&#x27;t get why many people have this mystical reverence for the \"unix philosophy\", as if having a large number of small processes that communicate via plain text was some kind of divine commandment rather than just one of many ways to design software (and not necessarily that good for tasks other than slicing and dicing text). I&#x27;m guessing that you do your image editing in a program like GIMP or Photoshop rather than with a bash shell, pipes, and a hundred tiny programs that input and output text. The \"unix philosophy\" simply isn&#x27;t a good fit there. Having used both sysvinit and systemd when doing server administration, I find systemd so much better that to me, it&#x27;s evidence that maybe the \"unix philosophy\" isn&#x27;t the best choice here either. reply imtringued 1 hour agorootparentsystemd is a hundred tiny programs packaged as one big package by your distro. People don&#x27;t seem to understand that. reply mrlonglong 12 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t. reply zlg_codes 11 hours agorootparentprevnext [4 more] [flagged] pengaru 9 hours agorootparent> Have you seen the talks that he interrupts to take the stage for himself?Links to videos of such incidents or didn&#x27;t happen. reply zlg_codes 6 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ZTdUmlGxVo0?si=cdfBCvn50rEOOQEP&t=3203He interrupted throughout the talk and then gets up on stage at the end. Quite disrespectful, and it&#x27;s not even the talk I was looking for.Side note to flaggers: defend your decision please. I see no real errors in the comment. We&#x27;re here to discuss. reply mcpackieh 4 hours agorootparentYour comment is entirely factual and fair. Unfortunately the Lennart camp is never here to discuss. replykaba0 13 hours agoparentprevMany (or even most) of the issues with pulseaudio were actually sound driver bugs only being resurfaces by pulseaudio, as it was using them in a more complicated matter. It is pretty unfair to blame Poettering over anything wrong in your life, as many of you do, for some reasonx reply lupusreal 12 hours agorootparentPipewire fixed my longstanding trouble with getting Bluetooth headphones to connect, same kernel&#x2F;drivers under which pulseaudio was hopeless. I spent an hour power cycling my headphones and turning bluetooth on and off, restarting pulseaudio, fucking around with bluetoothctl, with the headphones connecting to bluetooth but not getting listed in pulseaudio... The usual nonsense except this final time my frustration overcame the activation energy to try something completely new so I installed Pipewire. It immediately worked and hasn&#x27;t broken since.Basically what I&#x27;m saying is that pulseaudio has serious issues even with new \"fixed\" drivers and distros switching to Pipewire is making the situation much better for many users. reply kaba0 4 hours agorootparentI believe pipewire just has support for more modern bluetooth codecs. reply ric2b 12 hours agorootparentprevHow does pipewire work around those driver issues? Could pulseaudio use the same techniques but there was just no development capacity for it? reply kaba0 12 hours agorootparentThese were only true of pulseaudio in the early days of it. They are solved for good, by “simply” fixing the most common drivers. But in general, it couldn’t have been solved any other way. reply wholesomepotato 12 hours agoparentprevThis needs to be said: Every single thing Poettering touched was huge improvement. A great hero of Linux userspace architecture. reply ratsmack 13 hours agoparentprev [–] But now, what are we going to do with systemd? reply galcerte 13 hours agorootparentUnlike PulseAudio, dbus, and other userland components, it is perfectly possible to have a Linux system which works with most software without systemd. runit and OpenRC are two of the most popular init alternatives, which are just inits, and nothing else, unlike systemd. You might argue you have to use logind and udev, but that has been spun off into elogind and eudev. There is also seatd as an alternative to elogind, which is quite big itself. reply Levitating 13 hours agorootparentprevJust use it? I am still confused why systemd is supposedly something that needs to be fixed. Like all major distributions \"accidentally\" switched to it. reply ratsmack 13 hours agorootparentThey all switched because of commercial interests, not because everyone loved it. reply kaba0 13 hours agorootparentThese takes are just ridiculous. Debian, with a more democratic system than any country on Earth, voted twice over the issue, overwhelmingly supporting the support of only systemd. How is that commercial interest? Then arch decided for the same thing independently. I’m sure arch linux is the core interest of every commercial vendor, right?Just accept it, package maintainers had enough of the absolute shitty state of init systems. Systemd solves this very complex problem elegantly, giving some standard userspace can depend on. reply mike_hock 13 hours agorootparentThe decision in Debian didn&#x27;t come that easily. The tech committee was locked in a filibuster over systemd for ages and the votes were 50-50. Then the chair cast his tie-breaker vote in favor of systemd and everyone on the other side flipped their shit. reply kaba0 13 hours agorootparentThe only remotely controversial option was whether they should “explore other alternatives” or not. reply mrlonglong 13 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s quite true I&#x27;ll give you that. But there are still issues with it. It keeps swallowing up bits like resolver and others. It should only do one thing well. reply Levitating 8 hours agorootparentI like what Benno Rice said[1] concerning a third \"system\" layer other than kernel and userspace. Systemd tries to fill that space entirely by providing a suite of tools that integrate well with another. But you are not forced to use these all of these, you&#x27;re not forced to use resolved over resolvconf.> It should only do one thing well.I know this is a popular principle that some believe to be part of the unix philosophy. But an OS should also be coherent. Some tools can do their own thing and be independent from the rest of the system. But I think this works best for simple userland tools, not tightly integrated system services.In any case I really like resolved.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;o_AIw9bGogo?si=tpiuOoPFddGsiBdo reply kaba0 13 hours agorootparentprevIt only swallows those things up if you consider KDE swallowing up painting programs like Krita. Systemd is both a program, a collection of programs. reply zlg_codes 11 hours agorootparentSystemd adherents cannot seem to get past this deficiency in the software&#x27;s messaging.Same with Wayland. \"it&#x27;s not a program it&#x27;s a protocol\"Still sucks, still is a thorn in my side and gets in the way.Systemd is an attempt to consolidate the OS&#x2F;service layer into one thing. Compilation options don&#x27;t mean shit when every component is tightly coupled to systemd, its journal, dbus, or some other quackery.Systemd would have been better as an entire distro to itself.But as usual, people cannot handle the idea of running anything other than what&#x27;s shoved in their faces from corporate programmers.If I wanted corporate software I&#x27;d buy Apple or Microsoft. reply kaba0 11 hours agorootparentSo as usual, we get nothing useful or remotely objective from “systemd-haters”. reply zlg_codes 11 hours agorootparentYour terms are impossible to meet. The moment I reach one goal, you&#x27;ll invent another. Not worth it my dude.I am doing something about it by researching ways to excise Red Hat from as much of the tech stack as possible. Can&#x27;t do much about the kernel, but every layer above it is moldable.I don&#x27;t care to provide &#x27;usefulness&#x27; to you; if you&#x27;re not paying me why would I give up any value?It was an arrogantly managed project using the guise of standardization to bypass people&#x27;s social tendencies. People are stupid, so they fell for the &#x27;only consider the code, not our social fuckery!&#x27; Hook, link, and sinker.It really opened my eyes to how ignorant and passive a lot of techies actually are. They&#x27;re happy to slurp up whatever&#x27;s advertised to them as the better thing.Systemd runs my current laptop and I hate having to dive under the hood for anything. In a sysvinit, runit, or OpenRC system, I can achieve things quickly and don&#x27;t need a book&#x27;s worth of corporate style documentation to operate my damn system.Systemd still doesn&#x27;t support a one-time script on boot. You have to hack together a unit for that. Most other systems just run an rc.local script in &#x2F;etc!Binary logs are only useful if systemd is running, and only that version of it too!Good luck understanding journalctl output. It doesn&#x27;t capture everything.Long story short, systemd has not improved a single area of my computing life. I guess I can ogle at a boot time graph. But the main goal seems to be for systemd to take away knowledge of the lower levels of the stack.Like it or not, open software ecosystems are resistant to standardization by default.Systemd and dbus and friends would not have bothered me if they weren&#x27;t coupled with weird ideology about One True Linux or other crap.Systemd never solved problems for me. I&#x27;m sure it solves many business problems but none of them apply to me. reply Novosell 7 hours agorootparentYou think systemd was developed as a ploy to make people more ignorant? With what goal in mind? Selling support contracts? reply zlg_codes 6 hours agorootparentI think systemd was developed to make a libre replacement for SMF, that supported socket-based activation and deterministic boot. Those were two of the project&#x27;s original goals, but the endgoal I think was to develop this capability for open source Red Hat, SuSE and friends, get it on every distro, then use their influence at lower levels of the stack -- only one higher than the kernel itself! -- to have effective control over the open source ecosystem at a low level.Poettering worked for Red Hat during the development of both PulseAudio and systemd.

    "originBody": "Table of Contents Introduction Data Online Chess Rating Data Offline Chess Results Biggest Upsets Performance Elo Rating - Calibration Rating Calibration - Chess.com vs Fide Ratings for Online Games Anaylsis - Error over time Anaylsis - Difference in Difference Conclusion Appendix Simulation Glicko vs Elo IntroductionPermalink A month ago I published a blog article dicussing why I do not think that there is any statistical evidence of widespread cheating in Titled Tuesday tournaments. I did not say that cheating is non-existent, I simply showed that looking at the data, the claim that a significant percentage of players are consistently using engine evaluations is unfounded. Since then, a former World Champion published an hour long video, and accused Hikaru Nakamura of cheating. Chess.com increased their efforts to catch cheaters, and the chess community has been in an uproar. The methodology I used in the last post closely aligned with the one reportedly used by the team of mathematicians of a former world champion, who sparked this debate. The internet, and I, were however not satisfied by this methodology. The most salient counter argument arising from the discussion was that this methodology would not catch “smart” cheaters who use the engine evaluations only in critical positions or once or twice per game. Something that Fabiano said in his podcast peaked my interest. He claimed that first, cheating has only taken off after the “chess-hype” in November of 2020 where significant amounts of money were suddently to be gained from online chess. Second, he stated that while cheating has increased online, it has not increased offline. The statistical minds among you will immediately see that this is a perfect opportunity for a difference-in-difference analysis. We have four conditions, first and second time period, online and offline. We can compare the change in cheating between online and offline, and see if there is a significant difference. This much more robust methodology does not relieve us from defining some measure of cheating. ELO is an amazing system, predicting the winning probability of a player based on their and their opponent’s past perfomance. If there are cheaters online, this would be reflected in the ELO expectations of a games result becoming less predictive of the true outcome of a game. A 2400 playing like a 2600 against a 2700 rated player would increase their winning changes from 15.09% to 35.99%. In contrast to my previous blog article, this methodology does not examine any individual player, it mereley investigates whether the statistical properties of the ELO system have changed and thereby proves whether cheating has increased or not. The amazing thing about this methodology is that it does not matter how the cheaters cheat, as long as they do so in a way that changes their winning chances. There is, however, one problem. Let’s assume a 2400 has found a way to calibrate the amount of cheating to reliably play at a level of 2600. We would no longer find any statistical incrongruencies in the ELO system. Therefore, we need to match titled players to their official (offline) FIDE rating. We can then compare how the winning chances of these players have changed between the two time periods with a rating that is unpolluted by cheating on Online servers. Before diving into the data and results, two aspects need highlighting. First, online and offline chess naturally differ in expected ways - more flagging, premoves, streaming distractions, etc. Second, the pre- and post-hype eras likely differ as new players joined, ratings shifted, and motivation varied. We intentionally disregard these predictable differences. We are solely interested in the difference between the changes in Elo accuracy over time, online versus offline. This is known as a difference-in-differences analysis. To understand why, consider a famous minimum wage study. Economists David Card and Alan Krueger compared unemployment rates before and after New Jersey raised its minimum wage, versus Pennsylvania which did not. If unemployment rose in both states, it would reflect broader economic trends, not the wage change. And just comparing unemployment rates would not isolate the wage impact from other changing factors. By comparing the difference in the change in unemployment between states, they isolated the wage impact from broader economic factors. Similarly, we compare how Elo accuracy has changed over time, online versus offline. This methodology isolates the potential impact of increased cheating online from other realities of online chess. We purely examine whether Elo became a weaker predictor online versus offline after the 2020 boom. DataPermalink Online ChessPermalink Titled Tuesday has been running since 2014. I downloaded 540.666 unique titled tuesday games and results from Chess.com. We are only interested in the usernames of white and black players, ELO of White and Black Players (we will replace these with FIDE ratings), the result of the game, and finally the date of the game. Rating DataPermalink To match players with their FIDE rating, I downloaded a complete list of all titled players from the chess.com API. In total there are 11.820 titled players. Title GM WGM IM WIM WFM FM NM WNM CM WCM Number 1545 219 2117 369 634 3438 1846 14 1309 329 Subsequently, I downloaded all the information about these players from their Chess.com profiles. Most players list their real name and their Federation on their profile. I used this information to match the players with their FIDE rating. Fide publishes the entire data-set of all rated players on their website. To match the two data-sets I aligned their names and used fuzzy searching to find the closest match in the Fide data-set. In total 6.872 had a very close match in the FIDE list, with their federation and title matching up. There are dozens of articles online discussing whether and how Lichess and Chess.com ratings correspond to FIDE ratings. Please do not overinterpret the following gif. It is only supposed to show how strong the corelation between the two variables are and will not tell you what your FIDE rating would be. Offline ChessPermalink To establish an offline baseline, I used the Opening Master Database containing roughly 10 million historical and contemporary games played. I filtered this database to only include matches from Blitz or Rapid tournaments. This resulted in a list of 232.881 offline games. It shows three regresssions of chess.com ratings with the Fide Blitz, Rapid and Classical ratings. In general, Chess.com ratings are always higher than their Fide counterparts and the rating difference decreases with a higher rating. This map showcases all games played in the offline data-base. The scatter points in Europe and the US are roughly proportional to the number of games played in this location. If your city is missing - I’m sorry, it probably has multiple ways of spelling it and is therefore not being matched. ResultsPermalink Biggest UpsetsPermalink The top spots for the biggest upsets are all held by ███████████████ who entered a titled tuesday tournament with an astounding rating of 100. He defied the odds when he beat █████████ (2600+) with the ELO system giving him an expected outcome ofNote: I calculate the expected score always based on the winning probability of white - as the fomulae does not take into account the fact that white is more likely to win, the expected score is slightly overestimated. We see the same error for Chess.com. Even with much higher activity, a more sophisticated rating system, Chess.com still suffers from the same biases. However, this is not a problem for our analysis. We are not interested in the absolute expected score, but rather the change in the expected score between the two time periods and conditions (online vs offline). Rating Calibration - Chess.com vs Fide Ratings for Online GamesPermalink As cheaters will have a rating that is higher than their true rating, we need an external data-source for the ratings. As discussed in the introduction, we downloaded all available FIDE ratings, and matched them to the Chess.com ratings. The figure displays the calibration of the Chess.com ratings compared to different FIDE ratings. Unsuprisingly, best data-source are the Chess.com ratings with a mean absolute error of 0.35. In second place are the FIDE Blitz ratings with a mean absolute error of 0.38. The FIDE Standard and Rapid ratings are slighly worse with a mean absolute error of 0.39. The fact that the FIDE ratings are roughly comparable to the Chess.com ratings in terms of calibration is a great sign, as it means that we can use the Fide ratings to estimate the expected score of a game. Anaylsis - Error over timePermalink Before running any statistical tests, we’ll first have a look at the error over time. The figure shows the error of four different conditions. First, the blue line represents the prediction error using the Chess.com ratings. Second, the green, red, and yellow lines represent the error over time using the official fide ratings for the online games. Lastly, the black line shows the error over time for the offline games. We see that the error of the Chess.com ratings is consistently lower than the error for online games with FIDE ratings. As Chess.com ratings are much more accurate due to a higher activity online, this is not surprising. However, we also see that the error for the offline games is lower than the error for the online games. Visually we do not see any difference between the pre-hype and the post hype period. Anaylsis - Difference in DifferencePermalink To test whether there is a significant difference between the change in error between the online and offline games, we run a difference-in-difference regression. The dependent variable is the error of the prediction. The independent variables are the time period (pre-hype vs post-hype), the condition (online vs offline), and the interaction between the two. The interaction term is the difference-in-difference. If the difference-in-difference is significant, we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the change in error between the online and offline games. Variable Chess.com Rating FIDE Blitz Rating FIDE Standard Rating FIDE Rapid Rating Intercept 0.332*** 0.332*** 0.332*** 0.332***(0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) Online 0.019*** 0.055*** 0.065*** 0.059***(0.001) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) Post-Hype 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001(0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) Post-Hype:Online -0.003* -0.011* -0.012* -0.009*(0.002) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) Observations 718005 164222 169513 163871 R2 0.001 0.005 0.008 0.006 The figure displays the results from all four regressions (Comparing the prediction error using chess.com, Blitz, Rapid, and Classical ratings). In no condition do we find any evidence of cheating. Quite the opposite, the error actually drops for the online condition, while it rises for the offline conditions. ConclusionPermalink In my previous blog, I laid out why I am convinced that the allegations of pervasive and consistent computer assisted cheating do not hold water. In this article, I analysed whether there is any indication that cheating increased after the Chess boom in 2020, by running a Difference in Difference analysis, comparing online games to offline games. I found no evidence of cheating. In fact, the error of the prediction actually dropped for the online games, while it increased for the offline games. I am convinced that there is no evidence that cheating increased after the chess boom in 2020, compared to the offline baseline. I am also convinced that there is no evidence of pervasive and consistent computer assisted cheating in titled tuesday tournaments. AppendixPermalink SimulationPermalink I simulated a tournament of 500 players playing 22 rounds (early and late titled tueday). The players have normally distributed elo-ratings. However, a variable amount of people are “cheating”. They still have an official Elo-Rating but play according to another Elo-Rating, and thereby change the probable outcome. The right pane shows the average prediction error for a given Number of Cheaters and Cheater Elo combination. The left-most pane shows the percentage of times that a simple t-test detected a significant change in the prediction error for each tournament at a 5% (left) and a 1% (center) confidence level. We are already able to detect cheating with relative confidence when only 10/500 people are cheating. If 10% of people are cheating, we can detect it with almost 100% confidence, even if the cheaters are “only” playing at a level of 2600 Elo. Glicko vs EloPermalink Nerd Alert: Chess.com actually uses the Glicko instead of the ELO rating system. Glicko takes into account how volatile your rating is, and how many games you have played. The formulae for the expected score of a game and elo are not the same. However, for active chess players, the expected score estimation in Glicko doesn’t differ significantly from Elo. This is because the rating deviation (RD), a measure of uncertainty in a player’s rating, tends to be low for players who compete frequently. With a low RD, the Glicko expected score formula, which adjusts for player reliability, is roughly equivalent to the ELO formula. Therefore, for the purpose of estimating expected scores, not rating changes, the difference between using Glicko and Elo is minimal for active players. Because I do not have access to the RD of the players, I will use the Elo formulae to estimate the expected score of a game.

If you&#x27;ve ever watched how fast he moves and quite often pre-moves & talks through his strategy as he goes, it&#x27;d be very surprising to see that he cheated (and I don&#x27;t even know how he&#x27;d go about doing so - he&#x27;s faster than the engines!). reply hibikir 13 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think he was cheating, if just because he was playing a series of players far, far lower than his standard level, and he proves that level in tournaments that have far superior anti-cheating requirements.However, could he be cheating, if he wanted to, in ways undetectable by the livestreaming? Absolutely! At the GM level, just having the evaluation visible somewhere is more than sufficient to gain 100 points of ELO: You know when your opponent blunders, and if you are winning. That can be setup trivially somewhere out of view. He doesn&#x27;t need to be told one move, ever.See, for instance, Carlsen-Caruana WCC, game 6. Ended in a draw. But there was a mate in 30 once, that neither player saw. The moment Fabiano was told of the mate in 30, after the game, he started blurting out the right line... because if there&#x27;s mate in 30, there was only one way it could possibly go, but it was too hard to calculate. Mate in 30 says &#x27;yes, the really crazy line that you saw works out!&#x27; The same can happen in blitz.As for Hikaru being faster than the engine... it&#x27;s a crazy claim that he wouldn&#x27;t believe himself. At any and all time controls, the engine wins, all the time. The calculations from the previous move already included every move your opponent does... It&#x27;s just that the lame browser engines aren&#x27;t set up to remember the line from move to move, so they recompute. See what happens with any engine in the cloud, using aggressive parallelism, the kind a super GM uses to study.There&#x27;s minimal cheat prevention in titled Tuesday. Even when streaming, cheating is trivially easy to do, by anyone. But this is a place where Kramnik is overplaying his hand. There&#x27;s probably many players making money in titled tuesday by cheating, as their performance is so very far from over-the-board performance, it&#x27;s highly suspicious. But the top dozen super-GMs, for which Titled Tuesday money is unimportant? The statistical differences vs their regular play would have to be far bigger than what Kramnik shows for them. reply trollied 12 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s just that the lame browser engines aren&#x27;t set up to remember the line from move to move, so they recompute.I didn&#x27;t realise this.

No.Do I think it&#x27;s possible to cheat at his level, it would be an art to cheat in rapid and not get in trouble at the rate he plays. But sure, I&#x27;ll bite, why not.You can see that Hikaru has the ability to calculate and anticipate standard play far above his opponents, he calls out their moves before they make them. He clearly calculates both, he calculates the human line for him and his opponents.You can also see the tilt in chess vs say LoL in almost real time. You can begin to spot fatigue in an hour-long video, multi-hour stretch, you can see Hikaru get tried and change the way he plays, slow down, go for positions that are easier to play because he knows himself very well.Hikaru taking 2900s to town on chess.com simply looks like he is playing above the field at that pace. In a real tournament, with 90+ minutes, 2500-2600s give both Magnus and Hikaru trouble because there is so much more time to calculate. I think the reason why Hikaru is so strong, pattern recognition at this speed, instinct, and time spent playing, not strength necessarily in classical chess. (e.g. he has never been world champ) reply TacticalCoder 8 hours agoparentprev> Hikaru talking about the cheating allegation against him: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Zm2R--_fBj0He seems very amused by the accusation in that video.Regarding his video to me this sounds like if you were to ask Djokovic to play 46 tennis matches versus players ranked between 5 and 400 in the world, could he win 45 out of 46 matches and draw one game (not possible in tennis but hey)?I mean: Djokovic literally won 41 matches in a row, including several matches against opponent from the top 5.From the opponents&#x27; list, it looks like there was no Magnus Carlsen and not any top 5 players in the world?Is it that surprising that a world champion crushes competition like that?I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m not that suprised.P.S: I&#x27;m making a tennis analogy because Hikaru likes and plays tennis reply p1necone 7 hours agorootparent> this sounds like if you were to ask Djokovic to play 46 tennis matches versus players ranked between 5 and 400 in the world, could he win 45 out of 46 matches and draw one game (not possible in tennis but hey)?Not quite, it&#x27;s more like watching Djokovic&#x27;s match record until he gets a really good streak and then calling that particular run out as unlikely. It being specifically 46 matches is just because that&#x27;s the particular length of data that Kramnik cherry picked to do his analysis on. reply sn0n 1 hour agorootparentprevI&#x27;m going to need a statistical analysis of Hikaru&#x27;s Tennis matches before I can assume anything.

There is a software that reads the chesscom&#x2F;lichess board in real-time, calculates a bunch of lines using a chess engine and overlays the evaluation of the next best moves over the chesscom board. You can then choose the move that you feel most comfortable with. You never need to look away from the board or switch focus from the browser window. This software doesn&#x27;t need to be always running. You can start it with a hotkey on demand.

This is how he compensates his frustration when he loses.The weird thing is, Kramnik actually cheated himself, when he became world champion.

Or is there functionality past what can be found on the respective sites? reply vichu 7 hours agoparentprevWhere have I seen this UI before? :) reply nebulous1 12 hours agoprevRegarding the list of noteworthy upsets, it&#x27;s worth noting that, while I didnt go through all of the games, the top three results were all due to the stronger player making easy to spot blunders and the lower rated (but still strong) player converting. reply wufufufu 13 hours agoprevDoesn’t make much sense for Hikaru to cheat. He competes over the board where it’s much harder to cheat, and he makes most of his money through streaming, not through competition results. reply fairity 11 hours agoparentThe size of his streaming audience is largely predicated on his perceived skill though. So, he may hypothetically feel pressure to cheat in order to impress his audience. reply jaxr 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure that translates very linearly. Most of the chess YouTube \"stars\" are not even GMs. Most of the viewers are hardly good players, so what you can learn from an IM is astronomical. Charisma and good at teaching are much better skills than a 1000 ELO difference imo. To your point, beating Magnus might drag a lot of people to his stream. reply paulddraper 10 hours agorootparent> Most of the chess YouTube \"stars\" are not even GMs.But they have tutorials, put tons of effort into entertaining content, etc.Hikaru doesn&#x27;t.People watch Hiraku because they want to watch a top 5 player. reply lupire 10 hours agorootparentThey watch Hikaru because he is fun while he plays and wins.Offline, he is #4 is slow chess and #1 in Blitz.He&#x27;s not facing strong challenges on Titled Tuesday, and (like all top players) he is so good that there simply aren&#x27;t enough players and data to make the empirical Elo scale work for assessing his win probabilities. reply drexlspivey 10 hours agorootparentprevThat’s right, the most popular content creator on Youtube is an IM and the most popular game analysis channel is by an amateur reply TylerE 3 hours agorootparentThat’s nothing new. Many of the books supposedly by GMs are ghostwritten by non-titled players. reply paulddraper 10 hours agoparentprevBut his appeal as a streamer is due to his strength.The stronger he is, the more his name is listed as the winner, the more viewers he has. reply rgoulter 7 hours agorootparentWondering if Hikaru is using an engine is a bit like wondering if John Carmack gets his insights from ChatGPT. reply makach 1 hour agoprevI am pretty sure everyone is cheating against me online; every time I get a player it is obviously a 2600+ player speed running online crushing my dream to reach a rating above 500. reply Santosh83 2 hours agoprevOn a related note, isn&#x27;t this one place where so-called Trusted execution and Web integrity would legitimately be of use? With a completely trusted path of execution coupled with browser integrity, a cheater would theoretically be forced to use an entirely separate device or source for moves, like a second screen, handheld, beads, whatever... which would need to be input moves in realtime and thus making it quite a bit harder and needed outside assistance. reply KingOfCoders 1 hour agoparent\"entirely separate device\"Like ... an iPhone with a camera that views the monitor, recognized the board and suggests the best move? reply toxik 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s the old philosophical impossibility of DRM to ever succeed. As long as the consumer is able to see the media, or the player able to play the game, it can be recorded given enough time and resources, same for cheating. reply hilux 3 hours agoprevInteresting.He concludes that cheating in Titled Tuesday must be virtually non-existent.Many elite GMs (even those more level-headed than Kramnik) would strongly disagree. reply RockRobotRock 6 hours agoprevHe&#x27;s talking about Vladimir Kramnik and this video BTW: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_jk_r8FeREMSaved you the work of the digging I had to do as someone that&#x27;s not in the loop reply Tao3300 13 hours agoprevWhat&#x27;s going on in the picture?

Electric Light Orchestra), and you can even easily define pseudo-definitions for it as a backronym - &#x27;expected logistic odds&#x27;, just off the top of my head.I host a copy of his book and I still struggle every time to not type &#x27;ELO&#x27; instead. reply teo_zero 12 hours agorootparentYeah, I think we&#x27;ve been flooded by three-letter acronyms for so long that we see them everywhere. It doesn&#x27;t happen with four letters: you wouldn&#x27;t write VOLT or WATT. reply lupire 10 hours agorootparentSpecifically a 2 syllable 3 letter word that doesn&#x27;t fit a common English pattern (as it&#x27;s not an English name). reply latency-guy2 10 hours agoparentprevMost likely reason is because it doesn&#x27;t matter, \"Elo\" stopped being a person long ago, similar to many named streets, cities, states, etc. throughout the worldELO is just as accurate as Elo when referring to the rating system. reply lupire 10 hours agorootparentHow many of those cities and states became acronyms? reply latency-guy2 9 hours agorootparentProbably quite a few, I refer to some cities as their acronyms only such as NY, DC, ATL, SF, etc. - admittedly they still have their old name, but ELO and Elo still have their name as well reply soegaard 11 hours agoparentprevAnd why do they use Elo to refer to rating on chess.com and lichess? [They use Glicko&#x2F;Glicko2]. reply ghqst 11 hours agorootparentThe author has a short paragraph at the end about Glicko. reply soegaard 10 hours agorootparentYes, he knows his stuff. reply lupire 9 hours agoparentprevThey aren&#x27;t misspelling, they are capitalizing on the name. reply marcyb5st 11 hours agoprevWould it be possible to get some probability of cheating per player based on how often they play the best moves according to engines in online and live matches? reply busyant 9 hours agoparent> based on how often they play the best moves according to engines in online and live matchesOne thing that Magnus mentioned about a year ago (I think in relation to his oblique insinuation that Hans Niemann cheated) is that you don&#x27;t have to cheat throughout the game.He posited that if he checked an engine only once per game (at some critical juncture), he would be unbeatable (by any other non-cheating super GM).If you cheat like that, it would be considerably more difficult to detect.Caruana recently suggested that ~50% of players had cheated in cash online tournaments. He wasn&#x27;t particularly clear about what he meant by \"50%\" but I suspect he thinks that many lesser GMs have done what Magnus suggested: they occasionally \"dip their toe\" into the cheating realm by checking at some critical point against a more formidable opponent.They don&#x27;t even need to do this every game. And, human nature being what it is, I bet they can convince themselves that it&#x27;s not really cheating (e.g., \"I was just double checking my favorite move....\") reply lysp 3 hours agorootparent> He posited that if he checked an engine only once per game (at some critical juncture), he would be unbeatable (by any other non-cheating super GM).Not even to that extent.They just need to be told which single move mid-game to think harder on, and they&#x27;ll often find it.So all they need is a metaphoric tap on the shoulder. reply ps256 11 hours agoparentprevYou need something more sophisticated, otherwise it&#x27;s easy to confuse high skill and&#x2F;or well memorised lines with cheating. And a good cheater will be smart enough to either use engine assistance only in difficult spots and&#x2F;or frequently pick the second&#x2F;third best moves from the engine. reply paulddraper 10 hours agorootparentI think the parent&#x27;s idea is that over-the-board is harder to cheat; therefore you could look at the difference between OTB and online play. reply 83457 9 hours agorootparentBut otb is more stressful. reply tobias_irmer 3 hours agoprevWhere exactly is \"Zürich, Switherland\"? reply defrost 3 hours agoparentMost probably in Germany, Austria or Switzerland where the QWERTZ keyboard is widely used and the Z and Y are swapped (leading to an easy one key slip between the H and the Z). reply KingOfCoders 1 hour agorootparentNice find though I personally always slip left or right, not up or down. reply defrost 1 hour agorootparentIt struck me as an interesting puzzle; was this a curious locale spelling variation, a typo, a speech to text artifact, etc?The above is a best guess and the first time I&#x27;d come across that keyboard layout. reply kookamamie 14 hours agoprevnext [5 more] [flagged] Bootvis 14 hours agoparentWhat&#x27;s wrong with it? reply kookamamie 4 hours agorootparentThe somewhat obvious typo of \"analysis\" repeating in the article? reply scott_w 12 hours agorootparentprevHikaru has done multiple videos on why it’s total nonsense, pointing to statisticians from multiple universities that detail the problems in his thinking.In short, he tries to pretend Elo doesn’t exist and there’s no way a top 10 GM could repeatedly defeat FMs and IMs rated 400 points lower. reply sebzim4500 10 hours agorootparentOk but that&#x27;s not what was posted. The OP looks reasonable to me. reply johndhi 14 hours agoprevHmm it&#x27;s a little odd - he says there isn&#x27;t persistent cheating, but that&#x27;s in a world where chess.com bans people all the time for cheating.So what he&#x27;s saying is the chess.com anti cheat techniques are effective (for now), at least with respect to this specific tournament. reply MauranKilom 13 hours agoparent> he says there isn&#x27;t persistent cheating...in titled Tuesday, i.e. when there is a real-life name and chess career on the line. reply bongodongobob 13 hours agoparentprevNo, chess cheating is rampant. But it&#x27;s highly unlikely the professionals are doing it. reply umvi 12 hours agoprevControversial opinion, but what is the point of becoming a pro chess player in a world of computers? Any novice can beat you when assisted by an engine. The same can&#x27;t be said of other professions. A novice can&#x27;t design a better bridge than a civil engineer just by using cots software. reply michaelt 12 hours agoparentWhat&#x27;s the point of being a professional runner, when motorbikes exist?People can get enjoyment from doing (and watching) people doing things, even if machines can do it better. reply throw_pm23 12 hours agorootparentArguably nothing.Amateur running seems to make more sense. reply paulsutter 12 hours agorootparentprevStatus-seeking is the reason folks focus on professional running, or professional chess, or any of these very hardcore, very difficult endeavors that have no practical purpose.Someone once commented that men make extraordinary efforts to impress women, yet in general have very little understanding of what women actually like. This explains jacked-up trucks, professional chess, professional running, etcEDIT: I&#x27;m talking about professional-level running or chess, not the hobbies of running or chess reply initplus 12 hours agorootparentSurely nobody becomes a professional chess player because they think it will impress women. reply huevosabio 12 hours agorootparentprevI think you dismiss the thrill of being really good at something.We humans get a lot of satisfaction of improving and competing in all sorts of activities.The world is so big that for any activity you&#x27;ll find a good deal of people obsessed with that activity, and making it their life&#x27;s work to perfect it. reply zem 11 hours agorootparentprevI feel like for most competitive activities like this, who you really want to impress is other people who do that same activity. (I play competitive scrabble, for which there is approximately zero recognition in the \"outside world\", but having your fellow scrabble players recognise your ability counts for a lot.) reply lupire 9 hours agorootparentAnd yet so many men refuse to believe that women wear fancy dress and makeup for each other, not for men. reply chongli 12 hours agorootparentprevIs there no room for enjoyment of the activity?

In Poly Bridge after finishing a level he generally looks at the leaderboard to see how the people that beat him did. There&#x27;s usually a bunch that used cheesy methods, but there are also often several where they actually just did a better design. Especially on levels where hydraulics are used to move parts of the bridge.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@RealCivilEngineerGaming reply lewhoo 12 hours agoparentprev> Any novice can beat you when assisted by an engine.A novice wouldn&#x27;t be assisted by the engine but rather be an engine-chessboard interface with no real input as far as the game goes. I think that&#x27;s a really weird take. You wouldn&#x27;t claim there&#x27;s no point in 5000m race when any person with a car easily beats you. reply lupire 9 hours agorootparentI can&#x27;t carry the car everywhere in my pocket though.Running ability is useful in real life outside of races.Very high chess skill is never useful in any environment outside of the artificially restricted game environment. reply recursive 9 hours agorootparentThe analogy holds. Deep thinking is useful in real life. \"Very high\" running skill is not useful in any environment outside of artificially restricted controlled races. reply somenameforme 5 hours agoparentprevIn 50-60 years from now you&#x27;ll almost certainly be dead, if you&#x27;re unfortunate it might be much earlier. And along the way everybody and everything you&#x27;ve ever known will also die. Literally nothing anybody does has any grand point or meaning.All life comes down to is fulfillment. And chess, for many, is one of the most absurdly fulfilling and satisfying things that there is. And what makes the game so special is that as you become better at it, it becomes even more fulfilling and satisfying. And there&#x27;s no real limit to how much you can improve. And the cost of it is practically $0. And so all a pro is, is somebody who takes their fulfillment of the game to an arguably natural extreme. reply vharuck 12 hours agoparentprevLike all professional competitions: because there&#x27;s an interested audience with money.

For one reason among many more, a normal cheater will not really understand how difficult or easy some moves are and will tend to play a super-human move, requiring an exceptional depth of calculation, at the same pace which he plays a trivial recapture.Cheating in chess is maybe something closer to steroids in athletics. If you take an average Joe and gear him up with all the steroids in the world, he&#x27;s not suddenly going to just hulk out and become a world class athlete, contrary to what many think. But if you take a world class athlete and gear him up, he is going to be able to use that gain a substantial and unfair advantage over his clean peers. reply paulddraper 7 hours agorootparentprevYes, except that cheating is not that rampant.Maybe for Title Tuesday IDK, but not for most competitive chess. reply jcalabro 9 hours agoparentprevLove of the game.
