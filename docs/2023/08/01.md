## [NASA mistakenly severs communication to Voyager 2](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/31/nasa_mistakenly_disconnects_voyager_2/)

- The Voyager 2 probe is currently unable to communicate with NASA due to a misaligned antenna.
- This antenna misalignment has been ongoing for over a week, preventing the spacecraft from receiving commands or transmitting data.
- NASA believes that this situation is temporary and will not impact Voyager 2's trajectory or its mission in space.
- Voyager 2 is currently around 32 billion kilometers away from Earth and is moving further away at a rate of 15km per second.
- Voyager 1, however, remains in contact with Earth and is unaffected by this glitch.
- Engineers are working to fix the antenna alignment issue and extend Voyager 2's working life.
- If successful, a similar adjustment may be made to Voyager 1.
