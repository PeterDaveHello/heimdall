### [Why doesn't TypeScript properly type Object.keys?](https://alexharri.com/blog/typescript-structural-typing)

- TypeScript doesn't properly type Object.keys because of TypeScript's structural type system and its behavior with missing and extraneous properties.
- Object.keys is typed the way it is to enforce the acknowledgment that objects may contain properties that the type system is not aware of.
- Structural typing allows for more flexible and decoupled code, as demonstrated in the example of using a more minimal interface for a specific function.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36457557)

- TypeScript doesn't properly type Object.keys because of the limitations of structural typing.
- Object.keys returns an array of strings, not a type that corresponds to the keys of the input object.
- Using type guards, casting, or validation libraries like zod can help address these type issues in TypeScript.

### [Maker's schedule, Manager's schedule (2009)](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

- There are two types of schedules: the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses and operates on one-hour intervals, while the maker's schedule is preferred by people who make things (like programmers and writers) and operates in units of at least half a day.
- Meetings are disruptive for those on the maker's schedule, as they can break up valuable blocks of time and change the mode of work. This can be detrimental to productivity and ambitious projects.
- Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, operates on the maker's schedule and uses office hours as a way to simulate the manager's schedule within their preferred schedule. This allows for focused work time while still being available for meetings with founders.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36455843)

- "Tech Lead" positions in many startups can result in individuals being pulled in different directions, leading to ineffective performance in both their managerial and technical responsibilities.
- Maintaining a balanced schedule as a Tech Lead involves finding a rhythm that includes a combination of meetings, focus work, personal development, and exercise.
- It is beneficial to have team leads who can contribute technically while also participating in resourcing discussions to maintain a nuanced decision-making process.
