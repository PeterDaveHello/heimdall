### [A single line of code made a 24-core server slower than a laptop (2021)](https://pkolaczk.github.io/server-slower-than-a-laptop/)

- The performance of a benchmarking tool called Latte was unexpectedly slower on a 24-core server compared to a laptop, despite having more cores available.
- After investigation, it was discovered that the issue was caused by the use of shared reference counters (Arc) in the tool's code, which led to congestion and poor performance on the server.
- The problem was addressed by implementing separate reference counters for each thread, resulting in improved scalability and linear performance scaling on the server.
