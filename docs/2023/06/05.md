## [Why do railway tracks have crushed stones alongside them?](https://www.alpharail.co.nz/why-do-railway-tracks-have-crushed-stones-alongside-them/)

- Railway tracks have crushed stones alongside them, known as ballast, which serve a crucial role in maintaining tracks and ensuring the safety of trains.
- Ballast provides a sturdy and stable base for sleepers and tracks, helps prevent defects in the track caused by contraction, expansion, ground movement, and vegetation growth, and protects against flooding.
- Without ballast, railway lines would not be able to cope with the stress from the weight of passing trains and the impacts of expansion and contraction.

- Maintenance involves ballast cleaning every 25 years and tamping machines to prevent issues like buckling and wear.
- Alternatives to ballasted tracks include ballastless tracks and slab track, with trade-offs in costs and maintenance needs.
