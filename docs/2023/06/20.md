## [PostgreSQL reconsiders its process-based model](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/934940/3abb2d4086680b78/)

- PostgreSQL, a popular database system, is considering a fundamental change to move away from its process-oriented model.
- Developers believe that this change could address performance limitations on larger systems and reduce duplicated code, but there are concerns about potential breaking changes and loss of system robustness.
- The move to threads would present challenges such as reworking global variables and ensuring compatibility with existing extensions, but a previous threads port of PostgreSQL provides some insights for the project.

## [We tried to book a train ticket and ended up with a 245k records data breach](https://zerforschung.org/posts/freundschaftspass-en/)

- The article discusses a data breach that occurred during the distribution of free train tickets for young adults in Germany and France. The breach resulted in the exposure of approximately 245,000 registration records.
- The registration process for the tickets encountered various problems, including overloaded servers and a flawed password reset function. Additionally, a backdoor was discovered that allowed individuals to generate codes and complete the ticket ordering process even after it had officially closed.
- The data breach also extended to a similar program called DiscoverEU, which offers free Interrail passes for young Europeans. Over 245,000 registration records from DiscoverEU were found to be easily accessible on the internet. The issue has since been addressed and further security measures are being implemented.
