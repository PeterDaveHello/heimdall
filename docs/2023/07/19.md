## [Medicine is plagued by untrustworthy clinical trials](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02299-w)

- A significant number of clinical trials in the field of medicine may be faked or flawed, according to investigations.
- These "zombie" trials, which are studies that appear to be legitimate but contain flawed or fabricated data, can have serious consequences as they can be included in meta-analyses and systematic reviews, which influence medical guidelines and treatment decisions.
- Efforts are being made to address this issue, including implementing trustworthiness checks for trials and advocating for journals to require the sharing of raw data from authors. However, more work is needed to ensure the integrity of clinical trials and improve the quality of medical research.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36770624)

- Around a quarter of clinical trials in medicine are flawed or potentially fake, leading to unreliable results and potentially harmful treatments.
- The lack of transparency, reproducibility, and accountability in scientific research is a significant concern.
- Establishing an independent advisory organization and implementing open science practices, including the release of raw data, are potential solutions to improve the trustworthiness of clinical trials and scientific research.
