### [In the LLM space, "open source" is being used to mean "downloadable weights"](https://www.alessiofanelli.com/blog/llama2-isnt-open-source)

- The term "open source" is being used in the LLM (Large Language Model) space to refer to downloadable weights of AI models, rather than full access to the training code and dataset.
- There is ongoing debate within the AI community about whether open weights are enough for a model to be considered open source, as some argue that true openness requires sharing all training resources.
- The LLaMA2 model is an example of a model with restricted weights, as it has limitations on commercial use and training another large language model with its outputs. However, despite these limitations, the release of LLaMA2 on GitHub is seen as a positive development for the progress of the LLM space.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36815255)

- The term "open source" is being used in the LLM (Large Language Model) space to refer to downloadable weights, which some argue is deceptive.
- The debate over the meaning of "open source" and the licensing complexities in the AI industry raises questions about fairness, access, and the relationship between LLMs and copyright law.
- The restrictions on the use and distribution of LLMs like LLaMA2 may impact their commercial applications and lead to API-based access instead of downloadable weights.

### [Dementia risk linked to blood-protein imbalance in middle age](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02374-2)

- Abnormal levels of certain proteins in middle age could be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or similar conditions.
- A study following thousands of people over 25 years identified 32 proteins that, if unbalanced between the ages of 45 to 60, were strongly associated with an elevated risk of developing dementia later in life.
- The findings could potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic tests and treatments for dementia-causing diseases.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36813564)

- Researchers have discovered a link between blood-protein imbalance in middle age and an increased risk of dementia.
- The study identified 32 proteins that were strongly associated with dementia risk if their levels were unbalanced.
- The proteins are involved in proteostasis, immunity, synaptic function, and extracellular matrix organization.
- Some of the proteins were also found to be abnormally expressed in postmortem brain tissue from Alzheimer's patients.
- The findings suggest that dysregulation of specific immune and proteostasis pathways may contribute to dementia risk.
- The study genetically validated nine of the candidate proteins as markers of Alzheimer's disease.
- The research provides valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the earliest phases of dementia.
- More research is needed to understand the causal relationship between protein imbalances and dementia.
- The findings could potentially lead to the development of early detection and risk assessment tools for dementia.

### [Llama: Add grammar-based sampling](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1773)

- The post introduces a new feature called "grammar-based sampling" in the Llama software.
- The feature adds an API that takes a serialized context-free grammar to guide and constrain sampling.
- This feature allows users to specify grammars for generating different types of data, such as chess moves, arithmetic expressions, JSON, and more.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36819906)

- "Llama: Add grammar-based sampling" is a new feature that allows for more control over the output of language models like GPT.
- The feature uses a grammar to constrain the tokens generated by the model, resulting in more finely-grained control over the output.
- The addition of grammar-based sampling can help ensure that the generated text adheres to specific syntax or format requirements.

### [Nanosecond timestamp collisions are common](https://www.evanjones.ca/nanosecond-collisions.html)

- Nanosecond timestamp collisions are common on modern systems, occurring in approximately 5% of all samples when reading the clock on all 4 physical cores at the same time.
- This means that a raw nanosecond timestamp cannot be assumed to be a unique identifier.
- The behavior of timestamp collisions varies between different operating systems, with Linux showing consistent increases in both absolute and monotonic times within a single thread, while Mac OS X has a high number of collisions with microsecond resolution.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36810818)

- Nanosecond timestamp collisions are common and can lead to issues with generating unique identifiers.
- UUIDv7 is a proposed standard that combines a time component with a random component to create unique IDs.
- There is a debate about the accuracy and uniqueness of raw nanosecond timestamps, and alternative solutions like ULIDs and hierarchical sequential IDs are proposed.
