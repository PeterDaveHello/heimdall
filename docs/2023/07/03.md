## [First 'tooth regrowth' medicine moves toward clinical trials in Japan](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20230609/p2a/00m/0sc/026000c)

- A Japanese research team is developing a groundbreaking medication that may allow people to grow new teeth, with clinical trials set to begin in July 2024. The medication is intended for people who lack a full set of adult teeth due to congenital factors, and the team aims to have it ready for general use by 2030.
- The medication has already shown promising results in animal experiments, where it prompted the growth of "third-generation" teeth. This could be a game-changer for the field of dentistry, as humans have the potential to grow a third set of teeth but usually lose this ability over time.
- The medication works by blocking the action of a protein called USAG-1, which limits the growth of teeth. Once confirmed to have no ill effects on the human body, the medication will be aimed at treating children aged 2 to 6 who have anodontia.

- ML programs often focus on additive skill sets, but in reality, solving real-world problems requires knowing what not to try and understanding why certain approaches may not work.
- Many companies do not teach the fundamentals of statistics, and practical implementation skills are often lacking. It is important to find mentors who have both theoretical rigor and practical skills to solve problems.
- ML problems also require engineering skills, as certain techniques may not be scalable or suitable for large datasets. It is important to understand the limitations of different models and be able to mix them for debugging purposes.

## [Flattening ASTs and other compiler data structures](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/flattening.html)

- Flattening abstract syntax trees (ASTs) is a technique that can improve performance and memory efficiency in language implementations and compilers.
- Flattening involves packing AST nodes into a single array and using array indices instead of pointers to refer to child nodes.
- Flattened ASTs offer benefits such as improved spatial locality, smaller memory footprints, cheaper allocation and deallocation, easier memory management, and convenient deduplication.

- Blender, a 3D modeling software, uses identical on-disk and in-memory representations for fast and lossless file loading and saving.
- The trade-off of this design is that the data structure design becomes sticky and needs to be able to open files for older versions.
- There are ways to evolve data structures over time, similar to database migrations, that allow for updating older versions of files and avoiding the cost of compatibility each time.
