### [Underwater ears everywhere](https://computer.rip/2023-07-15-underwater-ears-everywhere.html)

- Hydrophones and wide-area sonar are important military surveillance technologies that are used to detect and locate submarines underwater.
- Submarines are difficult to detect and communicate with underwater due to the attenuation of radio signals by salt water, leading to the use of acoustic modems for communication.
- The US Navy's Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS), now known as the Integrated Underwater Surveillance System (IUSS), is a secret underwater surveillance system that uses hydrophone arrays to detect and classify submarines. IUSS has also found dual-use in marine biology research.
