## Automate Repetitive Tasks on Browser with Taxyai's GPT-4 Extension

TaxyAI is an open-source browser extension that automates tasks in a browser using GPT-4. Users input a task, and Taxy pulls the DOM and sends the remaining information alongside user instructions to GPT-4 to perform the appropriate action. Developers say Taxy can automate web-based workflows and learn from previous user interactions to adapt workflows. The extension extracts structured data from web pages, and uses LLM to suggest and enact custom workflows for that data. Taxy currently supports ad-hoc instructions, but future updates will include saved and scheduled workflows. Taxy simplifies HTML to include only interactive or semantically important elements, assigns an ID to each interactive element, and uses methods click(id) and setValue(id, text) to interact with webpages. Taxy executes actions using chrome.debugger API and updates action history before repeating the cycle. Taxy is open source and has a waitlist before it's available on the Chrome Web Store.

## Language AI Model Outperforms Humans in Tasks

The language model, ChatGPT, outperforms human annotators and Mechanical Turks for text-annotation tasks, according to a recent paper. ChatGPT was found to be 20 times cheaper than human MTurkers in performing certain tasks, scoring 75% accuracy on a task where MTurkers scored around 20%. Stanford University researchers used OpenAI's GPT-3 model to train a sentiment analysis tool that outperformed human annotators on a set of standard benchmark tests and was significantly more efficient and scalable than human labor. The capabilities of AI are growing more rapidly than previously believed, with AI predicted to take on physical tasks in the near future. Safety concerns around AI have not been taken seriously, and control of toxic language seems to be a priority. An ensemble of GPT-style language models was used to classify short text and improve agreement while reducing the number of incorrect predictions. Language models have limitations in their ability to comprehend and interact with the world around them, and the need for continued research into improving these models has been highlighted. ChatGPT outperforms crowd-workers for annotation tasks such as relevance, stance, topics, and frames detection, and is around 20 times cheaper than using a platform like MTurk.

## Stateless Programming for Simulations & Animations in Games

Game art for background animations avoids state and instead uses time-based noise functions. Delta-t is preferred over stateful operations for frame rate independent animations. Stateless programming minimizes variable use and relies on current time as a parameter for functions. Hybrid approach of minimizing state but using it where it makes sense is suggested. Closed-form solutions can eliminate stored state and create more deterministic and testable functions. Eliminating state can simplify code and make it more efficient and independent of frame rate. State is necessary in certain cases, such as user interfaces. Spending time at the whiteboard and considering alternatives to state can lead to simpler and better code.

## Debate on Necessity of Tiktok Ban for National Security

Debate on necessity of TikTok ban for national security. Some argue that Chinese censorship and data-sharing poses a significant risk to US national security, while others see it as a betrayal of the open internet. Critics argue that transparency rules should be enforced for all social media companies, not just TikTok. Ban on TikTok may have negative effects on US-China relations and lead to retaliatory measures against US companies operating in China. Conversation highlights the need for reform in privacy laws and concern over data collection and selective censorship by China. Some argue that psychological manipulation should be banned altogether, while others claim that banning TikTok alone does not solve the problem. Proposed Restrict Act bans TikTok in US as part of a larger bill targeting countries that censor American companies. Debate includes concerns over censorship, double standards, and the positioning of the US on the world stage. Move towards banning TikTok is likely a PR move that redirects attention from issues such as data selling and police surveillance. Best solution would be to pass real privacy, security, transparency, and accountability rules rather than ban a foreign competitor while giving American counterparts a pass for similar offenses.

The ban of TikTok in the US has sparked a debate on surveillance and free speech. Critics of the ban argue that it is a retaliatory act for China's previously imposed social media bans, while others raise concerns about national security and data privacy. The RESTRICT/DATA acts have also raised concerns over government surveillance and censorship, with critics arguing that they grant sweeping powers to the Secretary of Commerce. The REACH Act aims to prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control over American companies and technologies, but there are checks on this authority. The debate centers on national security concerns and the potential for a foreign country to have access to sensitive data, but there are also concerns about the potential impact on academic research and freedom of expression.

## Starbucks Violated Labor Laws, Withheld Tips & Raises from Unionized Workers

Starbucks has been found guilty of violating labor laws by the NLRB for withholding tips and raises from unionized workers. The NLRB ruled that Starbucks illegally ended access to electronic tip jars and digital pay stubs, and illegally implemented a minimum-wage increase while preventing unionized staff from combining it with tips. Starbucks has been ordered to provide affected employees with back pay and information on their rights to organize and unionize. Starbucks is planning to appeal the decision. Starbucks has been accused of violating regulations after introducing a virtual tipping system that some unionized employees claim is unfairly restricted. The company had denied unionized employees the right to virtual tips and pay increases given to non-union locations. Starbucks is facing fines for violating labor laws at three New York City locations, including retaliating against employees for unionizing and prohibiting them from wearing pro-union pins. In December 2022, the company illegally granted larger pay increases to non-unionized staff. Starbucks' CEO, Howard Schultz, is due to testify before the Senate HELP committee.

## Meat Industry Blocks Climate Change Diet Recommendation

The meat industry blocked IPCC's recommendation of a plant-based diet for reducing carbon emissions. The conversation turned political, with some defending capitalism, while others called for systemic change. The discussion highlights the tension between environmental concerns and corporate interests, and the need for systemic solutions for sustainable development. Arguments over the efficacy of vegan diets, political bias, and censorship of IPCC reports occurred. Evidence supports the health benefits of a plant-based diet, but there are also other effective diets. Animal foods have a larger environmental impact than plant-based foods, and subsidies should be given to plant-based alternatives. Lobbying by the meat industry prevented the release of a report on the impact of meat production on climate change.

## Managing Apple's .Ds_store File for Metadata Storage & Version Control

The .DS_Store file is created by Apple's operating system in all directories to store meta information about the contents, including layouts and sorting options. The file is not part of HFS+ or APFS, but rather a kludge to give Finder a place to store its own metadata. The file can be deleted without negative consequences, but it is invisible for users of Finder, making it the best solution. There are different opinions on how to ignore .DS_Store files in version control, with some suggesting a centralised exclusion file, while others argue for putting it in the project's `.gitignore`. Reading through several resources can provide a rough understanding of the .DS_Store file format before attempting to parse it in Go or Python. The .DS_Store file contains important metadata about a folder's tree and its blocks, including sensitive information that can be inadvertently uploaded to webservers. The author warns about the potential risk of .DS_Store files and recommends denying access to them or ensuring they won't be uploaded or committed.

## Choosing the Right Language for Efficient Problem Solving & Large Codebases.

There is no perfect language, and it's important to have a "pretty ok" language for efficient problem solving. Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one depends on the context and project goals. Rust, C#, and Python are versatile languages that can be used in different domains. Strong type systems are important for maintaining large codebases. TypeScript is recommended as a front-end solution over alternatives like updating Rails or Sorbet. Rust is viewed as a superior language with excellent tooling and deployment, but its move and borrowing semantics may be overkill for web projects. Rust's ability to operate as a safer language at a lower level makes it a viable choice for certain tasks. Rust eliminates bugs with its C-like macros and consistent language, but the combination of destructors and unwinding can lead to bugs in unsafe code. The use of Tokio is recommended for HTTP servers in Rust, with Axum, actix-web, and Rocket as popular frameworks.

## Efficient Programming with Interaction Nets & Combinators.

The post explores Interaction Nets, Combinators, and Calculus in the context of HVM, a functional runtime with parallel programming potential. Interaction Nets are coded via an undirected graph and have deterministic, Turing complete, and parallel-friendly programming capabilities that don't require a garbage collector for evaluation. Interaction Combinators, formed by Interaction Nets, have three nodes and annihilation and duplication rules that allow for any computation despite their simplicity. Interaction Calculus is a lambda calculus-inspired language that uses interaction combinators to symbolize lambda and lambda applications while incrementally cloning lambda expressions to eliminate the need for a garbage collector and optimize performance. This method allows for optimal reductions and simplicity, but may not always match the behavior of normal lambda calculus. The author is excited about this concept and plans to experiment with implementing it in a runtime that out-performs runtimes like Python and Javascript. The post concludes with an invitation for discussion and acknowledges the author's limited understanding, having only investigated this topic for four days.

## Rising Ivy League Tuition Costs & Value Proposition Debated

Ivy League universities in the US have raised tuition fees to around $90k per year, with increased financial aid to attract high-income families and selective admissions. Some commenters argue that elite schools aim to maintain high costs to filter out applicants who cannot afford tuition, although tuition-free options are available for low-income students. Discussions on the value of attending prestigious universities for career success and opportunities, with some suggesting it's more about networking and social value than education. State schools offer cheaper rates to in-state students. The cost of obtaining a college degree is increasing rapidly, but a bachelor's degree tends to pay off in terms of earnings power.

## Benefits & Drawbacks of Fuzz Testing Software Systems

The article discusses benefits and drawbacks of fuzz testing software systems. Fuzzing can be a cost-effective way to find bugs, but it can also be time-consuming and generate false positives. Defining allowable input data values and checking generative fuzzing for interesting scenarios is necessary. The author suggests leveraging existing infrastructure for manual test specification and reproducibility. A developer named matklad suggests using AFL to generate structured inputs for minimizing the test case and serialize actual generated data for test reproducibility. Keyframe predicates can help in interactive randomized tests, and FPRNG is useful for simulation. Matklad concludes that randomized and fuzz tests are still great [Discuss on Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35339521) or [Read Original Text](https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2023-03-28-random-fuzzy-thoughts/).

## Mesolithic Shaman Burial Site Reveals Spiritual Insights.

A burial site in Germany was initially interpreted as belonging to a Neolithic farmer, but recent re-examination by researchers revealed it belonged to a shaman. The shaman was likely chosen in early life to perform other-worldly rituals and help her community. The filed down bones suggest a pain ritual was required as part of her appointment. Her nystagmus, or abnormal eye movement, would have added to her credibility as an intermediary with the spirit world. DNA analysis showed that the shaman and baby buried with her were distantly related on the mother's side, rather than mother and child. The baby's bones showed signs of vitamin deficiency, suggesting his parents may have sought the shaman's assistance in vain. The shaman's grave contained offerings including bones of animals denoting their transcendent nature. The shaman was connected to a wider Stone Age society, as evidenced by the variety of flints from over 10 different rock sources, some over 50 miles away.

## Myers-Briggs Personality Test Deceptive, Flawed: Vox Report

According to Vox, the Myers-Briggs Personality Test is a flawed and deceptive test that fails to deliver reliable, accurate results. It has little to no predictive power regarding various aspects of life and is only useful for entertainment purposes. Despite being debunked by professional psychologists, many private companies and about 200 federal agencies, including the State Department, CIA, and military, continue to use it to categorize employees and potential hires into "types" and assign them appropriate training programs and responsibilities.
