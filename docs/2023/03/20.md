### [John Carmack's advice to a software engineering aspirant](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- In a Twitter thread, Oculus VR CTO John Carmack advised a person concerned about the future availability of coding jobs due to AI.
- Carmack suggested that if the person focused on building "product skills" and used the best tools for the job, including AI-guided coding, they would likely be fine.
- However, he added that software is just a tool to accomplish something for people, and it's essential to keep the delivered value in mind rather than over-focusing on the specifics of the devices.
- The person thanked Carmack for the advice, noting that they had never looked at things from that perspective.

- Ken Thompson gave a keynote speech at the SCALE 20x conference, where he spoke about his passion for player pianos and his 75-year project to build the ultimate player piano system.
- He shared how he started collecting MIDI files in the 1980s and grew to over 13,000 files, primarily duplicates, due to the MIDI community's tendency to steal and hoard files.
- He selected a few individual files from the collection and incorporated them into his player piano system, which he demonstrated at the conference.
- During the Q&A session, he answered questions on various topics, including his preference for Apple and his recent transition to Linux, his work on video and chess games, the use of velocity information in MIDI, his collection of Raspberry Pi computers, and his involvement in music metadata.

### [Bitwarden PINs can be brute-forced](https://ambiso.github.io/bitwarden-pin/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- A security researcher has found that if an attacker can access the encrypted vault data stored locally on a device and the user configures a Bitwarden PIN, the attacker can brute-force the PIN and gain access to the vault's master key.
- Bitwarden clients do not warn users about this risk.
- The issue arises when the user enables the PIN to unlock and configures Bitwarden not to require the master password on restart.
- The user's email and PIN encrypt the master vault key.
- Bitwarden allows only five PIN unlock attempts, but this limit is enforced only within the client's logicAs a result, an attacker can directly attack the encrypted data, trying different PINs until the data successfully decrypt.
- Mitigation and remediation options include better information about the risk, relying on a third party to enforce an unlock attempt limit, or relying on hardware security measures.
- Bitwarden has updated its documentation to warn about the risks of using the PIN feature, but it does not appear to have changed the client.

### [Expatriates leaving China](https://www.persuasion.community/p/leaving-china?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- The Covid-19 pandemic and political upheavals have caused many expatriates to leave China, putting into question the futures they have long imagined in the Middle Kingdom.
- The country's population decreased by more than 800,000 in 2022, the first population decline in over sixty years.
- While China is desperately looking to win back foreign investment and foreign professionals, it remains uncertain if foreigners will return and what their lives will look like in post-Covid China.
- The new generation of ex-pats will live under tightening restrictions and more significant uncertainty.
- This and heightened geopolitical tensions may stem the flow of ex-pats from America, Europe, Japan, and Korea.
- Nevertheless, a new generation of ex-pats- will be good for both China and the world, as the more engagement the country has with the rest of the world, the less likely it will be to isolate itself from the global community and turn inward.

### [Electricity Wasn't Always Seen as a Necessity](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-had-to-be-convinced-of-the-usefulness-of-electricity-21221094/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- Electricity was not seen as an essential product when it was first introduced, and the companies behind the technology had to persuade people of its benefits.
- An advertisement in the New York Tribune on October 5th, 1920, highlighted the importance of economy and efficiency in production, stating that electricity was the most effective agency in solving these problems.
- Electricity was sold to increase efficiency, reduce labor, and light up shops and factories, among other benefits.
- In 1920, New York Edison still had to persuade businesses to adopt their technology and the concept of electricity itself.
- With the competition from 30 electricity companies in the New York City area, New York Edison built a new power generation facility in 1920 that could generate 770,000 kilowatt-hours to outshine the competition.

### [Why Germany is building risk into its playgrounds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/24/why-germany-is-building-risk-into-its-playgrounds?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- Playgrounds in Germany are moving away from total safety and towards teaching children to navigate difficult situations.
- This trend has accelerated in Germany over the last five years, with a growing number of educators, manufacturers, and town planners arguing that playgrounds should create challenging microcosms that teach children to navigate difficult situations, even if the consequence is the odd broken bone.
- Playgrounds are seen as islands of free movement in a dangerous motorized environment.
- The umbrella association of statutory accident insurers in Germany has called for more playgrounds that teach children to develop "risk competence." Even insurance companies agree that children who had improved their motor skills in playgrounds at an early age were less likely to suffer accidents as they got older.
- The article also explains that the strict policing of standards in Germany enables a risk-accepting culture in playgrounds.
