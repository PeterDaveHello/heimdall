### GitHub Updates RSA SSH Host Key Following Exposure

- GitHub updates RSA SSH host key after private key exposed in public repository
- Customers using ECDSA or Ed25519 keys do not need to take action, but those using RSA need to update their ~/.ssh/known_hosts file
- GitHub has yet to introduce a mechanism for revoking SSH keys, which could be a potential issue if compromised
- Having a real-world risk/threat model is crucial for building reasonable security controls
- Git authors should sign their commits with their own private key for code integrity, rather than trusting hosting providers
- GitHub accidentally published its key, undermining the principle of trust and leaving all communications since its inception compromised
- GitHub is encouraging improvements to certificates used for logging into code repositories
- GitHub and GitLab both support two-factor authentication (2FA) via their command line interfaces (CLI)
- The recent incident highlights potential security flaws in many fintech companies, including blind trust in GitHub host keys
- GitHub briefly exposed a private key due to an accident, but took proactive measures to revoke and redeploy new keys and certificates, and implement enhanced controls.
