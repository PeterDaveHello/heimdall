### Apple's Neural Engine: ML Acceleration for iOS Devices

- Apple's Neural Engine is a specialized processor that accelerates machine learning models on most newer iPhones and iPads.
- The ANE is great for making ML models run fast on iOS devices, but not every Core ML model can make full use of it.
- Other companies are developing their own AI accelerator chips, and Google's TPU is a notable example.
- The discussion around the efficiency of owning expensive hardware that sits idle most of the time is ongoing.
- ANE is used for biometrics, image analysis, text to speech, and speech to text.
- Some mention that using a local model for transcription on the device with ANE kills the battery.
- Users discuss the neural engine on the new M1/M2 Max chip and suggest using CoreML as an abstraction for programming it.
- There is frustration over the lack of detailed documentation provided by Apple about the neural engine, while others speculate on possible reasons for this.

### AI Replacing Human Creativity in Creative Industries

- AI is replacing the jobs of 3D artists and other creative professionals, leading to concerns about the future of work and the role of automation in different industries.
- While some argue that AI is simply another tool that can help workers produce better output, others worry that it is fundamentally changing the nature of many jobs and creating a McDonald's-ification of industries.
- The use of generative AI in art and animation is upending the industry, but skilled creative directors with a deep understanding of different styles of art and framing angles can quickly generate the right prompts for AI-generated work, creating better results.
- AI is drastically reducing the time it takes to create art, which means fewer people will be needed. However, some argue that the resulting output is no longer the artist's own work.
- There are concerns about the limitations of AI-generated code, and the potential for snake oil salespeople promising to deliver fully functional apps without human involvement.
- Some express hope that AI will augment workflows and automate tedious tasks rather than completely replacing developers.
