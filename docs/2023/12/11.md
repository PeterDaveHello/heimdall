## [Inert Ingredients in Pesticides Could Pose Greater Threat to Bees](https://theconversation.com/inert-ingredients-in-pesticides-may-be-more-toxic-to-bees-than-scientists-thought-218005)

- Inert ingredients in pesticides, previously considered non-toxic, may be more harmful to bees than thought, according to new research.
- A study exposed honeybees to a fungicide containing both active and inert ingredients and found that the whole formulation impaired the bees' memory, while active ingredients alone did not.
- Inert ingredients have different functions and are regulated differently than active ingredients, making it hard to determine their toxicity. Comprehensive testing of pesticide formulations is needed to understand their impact on bee health. Changes to pesticide regulation could help protect bees by identifying inert ingredients on labels and requiring more testing on long-term effects.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38593008)

- "Inert" ingredients in pesticides, which are typically considered non-toxic, may be more harmful to bees than previously believed.
- A study reveals that the complete formulation of a fungicide impairs bees' memory, while the active ingredients alone do not.
- The use of pesticides has direct negative effects on bees and indirectly affects their food sources, making them more vulnerable to parasites and disease. The regulation and transparency surrounding inert ingredients in pesticides raise concerns about potential harm.
