### Arrest made in SF killing of Bob Lee – alleged killer also worked in tech

[Original](https://missionlocal.org/2023/04/bob-lee-killing-arrest-made-san-francisco/).
An arrest has been made in the killing of tech executive Bob Lee, and the alleged killer also worked in tech and was known to Lee. The police reportedly found Lee and the suspect driving together in a car registered to the suspect, and allege that some kind of confrontation took place while in the vehicle and potentially continued after Lee left. The coverage of Lee's death has been packaged with other recent San Francisco misfortunes and crimes, though this does not accurately represent the actual lived experience of most San Franciscans.

The murder of a tech executive in San Francisco has sparked discussions about factors such as homelessness, mental health, drug addiction, and poverty that may have led to the crime, but commenters caution against making generalizations. There is also debate about the use of statistics versus personal anecdotes when assessing crime rates, and a need for a community-involved approach to address the complex issues of homelessness, addiction, and crime. Users highlight the importance of evaluating crime levels in relation to poverty rather than comparing different cultures and not jumping to conclusions based on one case.

### YouTube-DL Hosting Ban Paves the Way to Privatized Censorship

A German court has ruled Uberspace liable for hosting the website of youtube-dl - an open-source tool that allows for downloading YouTube content. Uberspace warns the verdict could lead to privatized censorship and is appealing the decision, though the court held that Uberspace "can be held liable for doubting the validity of a takedown request," even when it was not clear that the tool violated the law.

### Apple will use 100 percent recycled cobalt in batteries by 2025

[Original](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/04/apple-will-use-100-percent-recycled-cobalt-in-batteries-by-2025/).
Apple has announced its plan to use 100% recycled cobalt in all Apple-designed batteries by 2025, alongside entirely recycled rare earth elements for magnets and 100% recycled tin for circuit boards. Their aim is to use only recycled and renewable materials and they already source more than 95% of tungsten, nearly three-quarters of rare earths, and over two-thirds of aluminum from 100% recycled material. Apple uses augmented reality (AR) to guide the disassembly of devices for recycling partners and increase rare earth element recovery, thereby driving industry-wide change towards reducing reliance on newly mined minerals.

Apple announced its plan to use 100% recycled cobalt in batteries by 2025 and reduce plastic waste, but users debate the efficacy of these changes and whether the company should make its recycling tech public. The debate over user-replaceable batteries continues, with arguments that they are environmentally negative, while others suggest recycling methods and extending durable product lifespan can solve this problem. Apple's commitment to recyclable materials and a carbon-neutral supply chain is praised, but criticized for its design and cobalt supply chain. Users discuss the lifespan of iPhones and Android phones, and recycling methods for batteries. Some users suggest MagSafe batteries as the primary battery for iPhones, while others question its efficiency.

### We achieved a 6-fold increase in Podman startup speed

[Original](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/speed-containers-podman-raspberry-pi).
Red Hat's container engine, Podman, achieved a 6-fold increase in startup speed by removing unnecessary processes and addressing minor inefficiencies that impact critical applications like cars, where near-real-time container startup is essential. The team used transient storage and provided workarounds for kernel issues, resulting in faster container startup. The use of --transient-store option is ideal for edge devices, although mixed mode containers are not supported.

Red Hat's Podman sees a six-fold increase in startup speed for cars, though Discussion Service users discuss the overcomplication of modern cars and raise concerns over reliability and maintenance. The discussion diverges into debates on the right to repair, the use of microservices and containers, and the balance between technological advancements and practicality.

### Improving Tailscale via Apple's open source

[Original](https://tailscale.dev/blog/darwin-spelunking).
The Tailscale team used Apple's open source to debug network-interface related bugs for their 1.36 release, relying on ifconfig to determine the active network interface. When Tailscale is configured to use an exit node, it becomes the default route, necessitating a fix to consistently "bind" network requests to the active network interface without causing looping traffic. SIOCGIFDELEGATE, available via ioctl, allows for the underlying physical interface to be obtained and was implemented into Tailscale's code for macOS and iOS.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35559124).
Discussion Service users discuss the benefits and challenges of open and closed source software in Tailscale's improvement via Apple's open source. Some pay customers prioritize the reputation of Tailscale's open source core product, while some raise specific issues with Tailscale such as difficulty accessing network shares on Windows 11 and potential battery drain on iOS devices. The discussion highlights the importance of considering various perspectives and Tailscale's gaining traction over Zerotier due to its mesh system and continuous deployment of new features, but revenue and moat concerns exist for some product users.

### Animated Drawings

### Nvidia RTX Remix Runtime Open Source Available Now

[Original](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-runtime-open-source-download/).
Nvidia has released the RTX Remix runtime, an open source modding platform for remastering classic DirectX 8 and 9 games with path tracing, AI-enhanced textures, and user-created assets. The RTX Remix creator toolkit enables modders to assign new assets and lights within a remastered scene, and use AI tools to rebuild the look of any asset. The RTX Remix runtime, on the other hand, captures a game scene, replaces assets at playback, and injects RTX technology, such as path tracing, DLSS 3, and Reflex into the game.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35552378).
Nvidia has released its open-source RTX Remix Runtime allowing users to play older games with ray tracing in real-time, though not all games will work. Hacker News users discuss the importance of open-source drivers versus proprietary drivers, Nvidia's reputation, and the poor performance of RTX on non-Nvidia hardware. Users also speculate on potential favoritism and suggest supporting cryptocurrency developers that implement GPU-only proof-of-work schemes. One user notes Remedy's development of Max Payne PC games remakes using Remix and discusses the tech's frame pacing and stuttering issues.
