## Beautiful branchless binary search

#### [News](https://probablydance.com/2023/04/27/beautiful-branchless-binary-search/)

- The article discusses a branchless binary search algorithm called "Shar's algorithm" described in a book written by John Bentley in 1982.
- The algorithm uses a loop with a conditional move instruction instead of a branch statement, making it faster on GCC compared to std::lower_bound.
- The variable "step" jumps in powers of two to find the middle element to search for, and the algorithm does more comparisons than the traditional binary search.

- Some commenters suggest optimization techniques for various hardware configurations, such as using SIMD instructions and prefetching, as well as the use of Profile-Guided Optimization with CMOV instructions.
- Developers discuss performance issues with binary search for close to power of 2 sized data, and the thread showcases various perspectives on low-level optimization and trade-offs between language portability and hardware specificity.

## How to spend money on your friends without it looking like bribery
