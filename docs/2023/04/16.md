## Valve Restricts Accounts of 2500 Users Who Marked a Negative Game Review Useful

[Original](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/23/04/14/175246/valve-restricts-accounts-of-2500-users-who-marked-a-negative-game-review-useful).
Valve has restricted the accounts of 2500 users who marked a negative review for Warlander useful, leading to a 30-day ban on up- and downvoting for those affected. Steam moderators classified the review as "attempting to scam users or other violations of Steam's Rules & Guidelines," resulting in the review's removal, and many believing the review system being "completely pointless" due to the impact of Valve's actions.

## What are transformer models and how do they work?

[Original](https://txt.cohere.ai/what-are-transformer-models/).
Transformer models are a new development in machine learning and are adept at generating coherent text by tracking context. With the ability to perform various tasks, such as translating between languages and answering questions, transformers consist of various components, including tokenization, embedding, positional encoding, transformer blocks, and softmax. The most complex transformer block employs attention and feedforward components, with multi-head attention used to modify vectors and provide more context. Post-training teaches transformers to perform specific tasks, and their ability to capture context has led to their success.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35576918).
Users engage in discussions about transformer models, questioning their efficacy and the comprehensiveness of promotional content. Alternative methods for tokenization are mentioned, and resources for learning more are recommended, including courses, videos, and papers. The emergent behavior shown by simple models in artificial intelligence and the connection between computational details and high-level behavior are explored, highlighting an active area of study called mechanistic interpretability.

## WebGPU Fundamentals

This post provides a set of articles for learning the fundamentals of WebGPU, including data memory layout, 3D math, and WebGPU from WebGL. The post also includes resources and references for further studying, as well as opportunities for contribution. Thank you to jrprice for their contributions.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35579334).
WebGPU Fundamentals gains attention on Hacker News as a successor to WebGL for graphics on web browsers. Users discuss potential applications for simulation, deep learning, and concerns about browser feature-creep. Comments also touch on web-based MIDI sequencers, experimental instruments, and WebUSB for firmware updates. Some argue the advantages of web-based tools, while others express concern over security risks and compatibility issues. WebGPU is not meant to be high-level or beginner-accessible but a low-level GPU API for expert users.

## Google CEO: "can we change the setting of this group to history-off" [pdf]

Google CEO Sundar Pichai faces accusations of requesting a change in Google Chat group settings to "history-off," despite potential legal implications and the violation of FRCP 37(e). Discussion Service users discuss the importance of preserving discoverable records and concerns over the legality of auto-delete practices, with examples of other electronic communication that deletes messages. Additionally, discussions on data retention, government regulations, and monopolies worldwide are shared, while concerns over Google's Android business and its lack of competition arise.

## Surviving Burnout (2015)

[Original](https://lifeofaudrey.com/essays/surviving_burnout.html).
Burnout in the tech industry is caused by a misalignment of responsibility, authority, and resources. The author's experience with burnout pushed her to quit her job and enter a period of recovery, which led her to start her own business. Burnout is a structural issue that requires structural solutions, with recovery support and funds being necessary for those affected.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35577285).
An article on Hacker News discusses the importance of finding balance to avoid burnout and maintain mental and physical health, while users share personal experiences and offer advice. Some Discussion Service users highlight the differences between depression and burnout, while others offer tips for dealing with burnout-inducing workplaces or starting a business as a potential solution. Several readers also discuss the efficacy of having a lifestyle coach or therapist to combat employee burnout, with mixed opinions. Ultimately, the key takeaway is that caring about work is important, but not at the cost of one's wellbeing.

## Low Code Software Development Is a Lie

[Original](https://jaylittle.com/post/view/2023/4/low-code-software-development-is-a-lie).
An experienced software developer argues that creating software is difficult due to clients and developers not understanding the root causes of problems they want to solve, rather than the fault of coding languages and tools. The author critiques the idea of "low code" tools such as OutSystems, stating that they do not remove the inherent complexity and may lead to poorly thought-through software systems, as well as being expensive and involving vendor lock-in. Properly designing a solution is the most difficult part of the software development process, and no tool can replace the necessary thinking, discussion, and planning.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35578240).
Low-code software development is useful for simpler problems but unsuitable for complex ones, and should not replace developers altogether. Discussion Service comments discuss the limitations and trade-offs of low-code platforms, including poor testability, versioning, and debugging tools that can lead to vendor lock-in. Some experts suggest that low-code tools can be valuable for prototyping and certain applications, but others caution against over-reliance on them and advise carefully selecting appropriate tools. While low-code has various use cases, the definition is blurry and potentially misleading, with Excel and shader graphs being examples.

## Remote code execution vulnerability in Google they are not willing to fix

[Original](https://giraffesecurity.dev/posts/google-remote-code-execution/).
A security researcher found a vulnerability in Google that allowed them to run arbitrary code on the computers of over 50 Google employees, caused by dependency confusion in Python's management system. Google initially classified it as severe but later changed it to intended behavior. The researcher fears the vulnerability could be exploited, as they have been receiving downloads from Google employees daily, and suspects Google does not understand the problem, or they do not care about fixing it.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35581532).
A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability found in Google's software is reportedly not being fixed, with some users pointing out that Java's package management system has a more secure way of uploading packages than Rust's system, while others suggest that `pip install --extra-index-url` ignores user-specific registries, rendering private registries useless. Google has zero-trust security measures to combat insider threats, but an APT could use this vulnerability to gain a foothold in the environment. The need for better package management solutions and the role of zero-trust in preventing such attacks are also highlighted.
