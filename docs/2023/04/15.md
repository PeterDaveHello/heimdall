### Temporal quality degradation in AI models

[Original](https://www.nannyml.com/blog/91-of-ml-perfomance-degrade-in-time).
A recent study from MIT, Harvard, and University of Monterrey found that 91% of machine learning models experience temporal quality degradation over time due to data distribution drift, termed "AI aging". The study observed three significant degradation patterns and concludes that continuous monitoring is necessary to mitigate this issue. Another academic paper proposes retraining the model with newly labeled data to address this issue, but highlights the need for an efficient and robust mechanism for automatic retraining and monitoring tools like NannyML to prevent failures.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35566145).
Experts discuss the potential temporal quality degradation of AI models, as they may reproduce past solutions, leading to oversaturated content, emphasizing the need to reevaluate the narrative. While users provide evidence supporting both views of AI models generating new concepts or being limited to existing data, the conservative bias of current training data and absence of clear understanding of transformed space are highlighted. Northwestern University research identifies the degradation patterns of machine learning models with datasets from various industries, with a call to retrain models on new data and the need for human oversight.

### The FAA has granted SpaceX permission to launch its Starship rocket

[Original](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/green-light-go-spacex-receives-a-launch-license-from-the-faa-for-starship/).
The FAA has granted SpaceX permission to launch its Starship rocket from South Texas, which is the final regulatory step that the company needed to take before being cleared to fly the largest rocket ever built. SpaceX is expected to hold a final readiness review this weekend before deciding to proceed with a launch attempt, which could occur as soon as Monday. The launch window is expected to open at 7 am local time in Texas.

SpaceX has received approval from the FAA to launch its Starship rocket, with discussions focusing on the significance of this allowing for the beginning of a new era in space exploration. Despite excitement over the recent clearance, potential launch problems and delays were also discussed, with insights into the development and potential impact of the Starship rocket.

### Prompt injection: what's the worst that can happen?

[Original](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/14/worst-that-can-happen/).
Tech experts are warning about the severe consequences of prompt injection in LLMs, which can lead to vulnerabilities in certain applications like ChatGPT Plugins and ReAct pattern, among other things, without any solution that guarantees 100% protection. Despite educating developers, prompt injection remains unsolved, and data exfiltration and SEO optimization hacking risk can harm the LLMs' development. OpenAI's GPT-4 offers a "system prompt" feature to prevent prompt injection, but recent advancements in LLMs can increase the vulnerability risk.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35572290).
Hacker News comments discuss prompt injection attacks on language models and suggest using out-of-band means, creating honeypots, and increasing security measures. The limitations of natural language as a means to codify boundaries for language models are also explored, with some proposing annual security training and ACL-aware models to address the problem. The vulnerability of LLMs to prompt injection attacks is gaining attention among tech experts, with concerns about bad actors exploiting poorly secured LLMs. The latest advances in machine learning models have created new vulnerability points, including prompt injection attacks, which researchers urge users to treat as inevitable. The difficulties of prompt injection attacks on language models and potential solutions, including implementing a human prompt or separating user data and system data, are also discussed.

### An open source AI tool to animate children's drawings

[Original](https://github.com/facebookresearch/AnimatedDrawings).
Facebook AI Research has developed an AI tool that can animate human figures from children's drawings, which has been made available on GitHub. The tool uses configuration files for character motion and rendering, and can export animations in various formats. The open-source repo includes model weights, figure detection, and an As-Rigid-As-Possible Shape Manipulation algorithm for developers.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35565681).
Facebook Research released an open-source AI tool to animate children's drawings, potentially leading to innovations in realistic cartoon and CGI characters, but some users think the project is just an algorithm, and others consider the tool to be at the bottom tier of animation, while others believe that bottom-tier animation from AI-generated images could become impressive in a few years.
