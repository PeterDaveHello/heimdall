## Spinning Diagrams with CSS

#### [News](https://x.st/spinning-diagrams-with-css/)

- The spinning diagrams presented do not use JavaScript or animated image formats; rather, just HTML and CSS.
- A spinning cube with letters at each vertex can be made using the transform property and keyframe animations with rotateX and rotateY.
- To keep the letters facing forward while spinning, another div around each letter can perform the unspinning with an opposite keyframe animation.
- The spinning and unspinning works well on mobile browsers and allows for even selected text to rotate.
- The original math thing involved other tricks such as embedding diagrams in LaTeX and generating geometries with a Python script.
