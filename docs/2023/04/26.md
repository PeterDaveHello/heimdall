## The EU suppressed a 300-page study that found piracy doesn't harm sales (2017)

#### [News](https://gizmodo.com/the-eu-suppressed-a-300-page-study-that-found-piracy-do-1818629537)

- The EU paid €360,000 for a study on the impact of piracy on sales of copyrighted material but never released the 304-page report, possibly because it found no "robust statistical evidence of displacement of sales by online copyright infringements."
- The only negative correlation found was that for every ten recent top films watched illegally, four fewer films are consumed legally.
- The report was only made public after Julia Reda, a member of the European Parliament, obtained it through an EU Freedom of Information access to document request.

## Microsoft Edge is leaking the sites you visit to Bing

#### [News](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697532/microsoft-edge-browser-url-leak-bing-privacy)

- Microsoft Edge appears to be sending URLs visited by users to its Bing API website, as users on Reddit have noticed.
- This is due to a poorly implemented new feature in Edge called "creator follow," which sends almost every domain visited to Bing as part of its functionality, even if it is not being followed by the user.
- Until Microsoft addresses this issue, it is recommended to disable the "follow creators" feature in Edge to prevent further URLs from being sent to Bing.

- Matrix multiplication is core to the development of transformers, which are neural networks used in natural language processing.
- Transformers use attention masks, multi-word feature building, and decoder stacks to efficiently process and generate sequences of text.
- Transformers can also process other types of data such as audio by pre-processing it into dense vectors.

## Use of antibiotics in farming 'endangering human immune system'

#### [News](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/25/use-of-antibiotics-in-farming-endangering-human-immune-system)

- Antibiotics used in farming are causing bacteria to become more resistant to the human immune system, according to research from the University of Oxford.
- Colistin, which was widely used as a livestock food additive in China until it was banned, has led to the emergence of E. coli strains that are able to evade the human immune system's first line of defence.
- There are concerns that the study's findings could compromise the development of new antibiotic medicines in the same class as colistin, known as antimicrobial peptides, which are naturally produced by most living organisms in their innate immune response.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35700881)

- Animal agriculture has negative impacts beyond antibiotic resistance, including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and waste management problems.
- The conversation includes suggestions to limit or eliminate meat consumption and adopt more sustainable practices, such as permaculture setups.

## Shell admits 1.5C climate goal means immediate end to fossil fuel growth

#### [News](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-04-24/shell-admits-1-5c-climate-goal-means-immediate-end-to-fossil-fuel-growth/)

- Shell has announced that continued growth in fossil fuel production is incompatible with limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C, and their new scenario involves an immediate end to growth in oil and gas production.
- The new scenario includes significant increases in carbon capture use, reducing energy demands, and a reduction in the company's reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
- Despite the decrease in fossil fuel use, the slowness of the decline would still allow for new fossil fuel production, potentially serving Shell's interests.

## Call on the IRS to provide libre tax-filing software

#### [News](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/call-on-the-irs-to-provide-libre-tax-filing-software)

- Millions of US taxpayers use proprietary software like TurboTax to file their taxes and feel they have no other option, which means giving up their freedom and private financial information to a third-party company.
- Upcoming legislation, like the Inflation Reduction Act, requires the IRS to research a government-operated gratis tax return system, and $15 million is allocated for this.

- The Americans for Tax Fairness Action Fund launched a petition calling for a gratis, "simple tax filing system that saves taxpayers time and money." The Free Software Foundation is calling on the IRS to make a website for filing tax returns using free software, and individuals can write to the new IRS commissioner with their preference for a software that respects their freedom.
