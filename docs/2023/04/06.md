## CAN Injection: Keyless car theft

[Original](https://kentindell.github.io/2023/04/03/can-injection/).
Car thieves are using a new technique called CAN Injection to bypass smart key systems in modern cars by exploiting vulnerabilities in the CAN bus communication protocol. Sophisticated car security systems, including engine immobilizers, have become vulnerable. Thieves use a device called the CAN Injector to steal cars without the key by injecting fake messages into the car's internal communication system. The device costs $10 and contains a PIC18F chip, pre-programmed firmware, a transceiver, and an extra circuit. A quick fix or cryptographic messaging can defeat the CAN Injector. Ian Haken outlines several ways automakers could help secure cars, but criminal exploitation of the technique is widespread. It is an industry-wide issue that requires an update of ECU software to defeat thieves.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35452963).
A keyless car theft technique known as CAN Injection was highlighted on Hacker News. Consumers should be wary of encrypting or signing CAN Bus as it may limit third-party diagnostic tools, adding to repair costs. CAN bus controls multiple vehicle functions, and vehicle manufacturers optimize costs ruthlessly. Automakers have legal requirements to separate from dealers, but some comments criticize their adherence to the spirit of the law. Premium car brands use various security measures to prevent car hacking, including immobilizers with proper cryptographic protocols to authenticate start-release messages and signed CAN/FlexRay/Ethernet frames to prevent message spoofing. Cheap cars are targeted as they are easy to steal, while expensive cars are the target of violent theft. The exploit described in the article could be applied to almost any non-connected vehicle manufactured in the last decade. The use of CAN bus in critical systems such as aviation and automotive is due to its simplicity of wiring and cost-effectiveness.

## Segment Anything Model (SAM) can "cut out" any object in an image

[Original](https://segment-anything.com/).
The Segment Anything Model (SAM) developed by Meta AI can isolate any object in an image with high accuracy. It can successfully identify and segment objects, even when they are partially visible or occluded. SAM improves on previously developed models that relied on location cues or salient objects. Rather than using these cues, SAM applies meta-learning, leveraging an existing model's learning, to be able to detect small, biased datasets or unseen objects. SAM can be used for practical applications, like image editing, as well as research in the field of computer vision.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35455566).
