## Supercentenarian records show patterns indicative of errors and pension fraud

[Original](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080v2).
A new study reveals that relative poverty and missing vital documents are unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status, with patterns indicative of widespread fraud and error. In the US, the absence of vital registration is linked to supercentenarian status, while in the UK, Italy, Japan, and France, remarkable longevity is predicted by factors like regional poverty, old-age poverty, and low incomes. Birthdays of supercentenarians are concentrated on the first of the month and days divisible by five. The study analyzes over 50,000 centenarians and provides predictive models of the density of remarkable age records.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35441997).
Supercentenarian records raise questions of errors and pension fraud, as birthdates associated with certain patterns are noted, with experts questioning the accuracy and reliability of birth records. Jeanne Calment, the oldest person ever recorded, is questioned for identity fraud, with some suggesting her daughter impersonated her, but some users dismiss the notion, and there is no conclusive evidence thus far. Blue Zones only label places with reliable data, leading to some rejections. Environmental factors can skew methods, like age verification, and cursive handwriting on old records can lead to unreliability. Tontines will be reintroduced in the US by 2023, with AI potentially helping.

## Levels of banned CFCs rising

[Original](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00940-2).
Researchers have found that levels of five banned CFCs have risen rapidly from 2010 to 2020, contradicting the successful Montreal Protocol that had called for their global phase-out by 2010. The CFCs are not currently a threat to the ozone layer's healing, but their impact on Earth's climate is significant, calling for additional concern. Chemical production could be causing the accidental release of three chemicals, while the root cause of the other two chemicals' elevation remains unknown, suggesting that increased global monitoring of CFCs is necessary. The article highlights the need to keep a close watch on the atmosphere's dangers, and possible amendments to the Montreal Protocol to address the by-product problem head-on may be needed.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35442001).
A report reveals that banned CFC levels are rising with an increase in CFC-13 emissions, which is concerning due to a lack of known chemical processes that produce it. Managing refrigerants is suggested as a solution to limit warming. There is a mismatch of incentives between factories, regulations and individuals for managing emissions linked to skin cancer. Possible solutions for addressing environmental concerns in countries with less regulation include imposing escalating tariffs on noncompliant nations with a focus on products with a known environmental impact. China is a potential culprit in HFC and CFC production, and progressive climate change policies face barriers to implementation within totalitarian societies. Experts refute the claim that record snowpacks are evidence against global warming due to the phenomenon of climate change. The US and China's emissions comparison reveals the US has been reducing emissions while China has increased 48% since 2007. Consumers are urged to buy products with a transparent supply chain and look for ESG reports while considering carbon tariffs on goods imported from dirty countries. Urgency is suggested for preventative initiatives, but cost and implementation will be difficult. The discussion highlights the need for a long-term global effort to address climate change and the potential for green technologies to be adopted by developing nations.
