### [HP disables customers' printers if they use ink cartridges from cheaper rivals](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/hp-printers-computers-ink-cartridges-rivals/)

- HP has issued a firmware update that disables the printers of customers using non-HP ink cartridges, sparking outrage among customers who feel "cheated."
- The new terms prevent customers from using any cartridges other than those fitted with an HP chip, which are often more expensive, and the printer will refuse to print if non-HP ink is used.
- HP claims the update is to reduce the risk of malware attacks and to maintain the integrity of their printing systems, but customers have flooded social media with complaints saying they feel "cheated" and that they are being denied their right to choose cheaper alternatives.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35930518)

- The company has updated firmware for almost 100 printer models, but some users claim to have successfully used cartridges from alternative brands.
- There is criticism of HP's business practices, with suggestions of fines, regulation, boycotts, and accountability for CEOs and boards of directors. Alternative printer brands such as Brother, Canon, and Xerox are recommended.

- A lawsuit alleges that TikTok owner ByteDance built a "backdoor channel" in its code that allowed Chinese Communist Party members access to user data hosted in the US.
- The Chinese Communist Party unit, known as the "Committee", had special powers to monitor ByteDance's business activities, demote unfavorable content, and even use a "death switch" to turn off certain apps.
- The lawsuit alleges that the "Committee" continued to have access to US user data after ByteDance walled off access for individual engineers in China.

### [Prompt injection explained, with video, slides, and a transcript](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/)

- Prompt injection is a serious security vulnerability for any application built on top of language models
- Proposed solutions using AI-based filtering may not work due to the unpredictable nature of language models and the need for 100% reliability in security
- A potential solution suggested by Simon Willison is the dual language model pattern, which involves building two different LLMs - a privileged one that is only exposed to trusted data and a quarantined one that is expected to go rogue. It is a fiddly solution but is currently the best option.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35929122)

- Research is underway to find ways to defend against prompt injection attacks, but caution needs to be taken when using LLMs for critical applications beyond content generation.
- Possible solutions to mitigate prompt injection include using separate LLMs with different privileges, developing a deterministic language model, and being careful with metadata and filenames in creating sandboxed AI applications.

### [RNA repair mechanism discovered in humans](https://phys.org/news/2023-04-hidden-rna-mechanism-humans.html)

- An interdisciplinary research team from the University of Konstanz has discovered the first human RNA ligase, C12orf29, which links RNA strands using adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
- The ligase is involved in a previously hidden human RNA repair mechanism that protects against oxidative cellular stress.
- The research team used CRISPR/Cas gene scissors to generate a line of human kidney cells to compare knockout and normal kidney cells under varying experimental conditions.

### [Ligatures in programming fonts: hell no (2019)](https://practicaltypography.com/ligatures-in-programming-fonts-hell-no.html)

- Ligatures in programming fonts are problematic because they can misrepresent the meaning of code or cause confusion among readers.
- Ligatures are special characters in a font that combine two or more troublesome characters into one, but they can easily be confused with existing Unicode symbols.
- Every character in programming code has a special semantic role to play, so any kind of "prettifying" that makes one character look like another, including ligatures, leads to a swamp of despair.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35925821)

- Recommendations for fonts that support ligatures and Unicode more broadly.
- Concerns about confusion among audiences unfamiliar with ligatures, particularly in presentations or exported code snippets.
