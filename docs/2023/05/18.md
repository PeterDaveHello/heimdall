### [Numbers every LLM developer should know](https://github.com/ray-project/llm-numbers)

- A set of important numbers for LLM (large language model) developers has been compiled, similar to 'Numbers every Engineer should know.'
- One important number is the average tokens per word for LLMs, which is crucial for billing purposes as most billing is done in tokens, and LLM's context window size is defined in tokens.
- Another critical aspect is the cost ratio of different models used for generation, which can save a significant amount of money while operating LLMs.
