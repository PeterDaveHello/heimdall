## [The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/)

- The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide is a free book that teaches readers how to write kernel modules, which extend the functionality of the kernel without needing to reboot the system.
- The book covers a variety of topics, including headers, device drivers, file systems, system calls, interrupt handlers, and scheduling tasks.
- The author recommends extracting, compiling, and loading all the examples from a console. The book introduces new ways to handle kernel module settings, including the use of macros module_init and module_exit, and explains licensing options for kernel modules. Additionally, modules can take command line arguments using global variables and the module_param() macro.

- eBPF is a newer and slightly easier/safer alternative to some kernel module tasks.
- The guide is a good starting point for learning about kernel modules, but may fall short when it comes to writing more complex drivers.

## [Microsoft broke a Chrome feature to promote Edge](https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-windows-google-chrome-feature-broken-edge-1850392901)

- Microsoft issued a Windows update that broke a Chrome feature, making it harder to change your default browser and annoying Chrome users with popups, Gizmodo has learned.
- The update affected Chrome's one-click "Make Default" button, and for enterprise users, the Windows default settings page would pop up every time they opened Chrome.
- This move is part of Microsoft's pattern of behavior as it wages war on non-Windows web browsers and the people who use them.

### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35787707)

- Google is developing a privacy sandbox, but the proposal is rejected due to tradeoffs between serving a diverse population and protecting user identities.
- Windows users on enterprise versions experienced default system settings opening every time they opened Chrome due to an API issue, leading to concerns over user privacy and potential anti-trust behavior.

## [PornHub blocks users in Utah, cites state's age verification law](https://kslnewsradio.com/2003298/adult-website-pornhub-blocks-users-in-utah-from-accessing-the-site/)

- PornHub has implemented a block on users in Utah who wish to access their site due to the state's new age verification law.
- The law requires pornographic sites to verify that a user in Utah is at least 18 years old, and non-compliant sites can be held liable for damages resulting from a minor accessing the material.
- PornHub argues that requiring ID isn't effective in protecting users and instead puts children and privacy at risk, suggesting that identifying users by their devices is a better solution.

### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35786086)

- There are debates about whether age verification initiatives are in good faith and about their effectiveness, as it requires a significant burden on porn providers and raises concerns about privacy violations and the creation of records.
- The discussions in the comments covers topics such as diversity and culture, government-mandated age restriction, parental control, and legislation on adult material labeling and categorization.

## [Let's make sure GitHub doesn't become the only option](https://blog.edwardloveall.com/lets-make-sure-github-doesnt-become-the-only-option)

- GitHub's dominant position in software development creates a risk to the industry, as it gives one company too much control and limits the use of alternative tools.
- The reliance on Pull Requests (PRs) as the default collaboration tool creates a culture of low-trust and restricts collaboration styles.
- Homogenization around a single platform is a risk, and developers should explore and invest in alternative tools to ensure a diversity of options and the resiliency of the software industry.

### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35787102)

- Various alternatives to Git and GitHub are discussed, including GitLab, Sourcehut, and Codeberg.
- The success of an alternative platform will depend on its ability to compete with GitHub's comprehensive search, reliable tracker, issue tracker integration, and basic documentation expectations.

## [faulTPM: Exposing AMD fTPMs' Deepest Secrets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14717)

## [Jsonformer: Generate structured output from LLMs](https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer)

- Jsonformer is a new approach to generate structured JSON from language models to ensure that the generated JSON is always syntactically correct and conforms to the specified schema.
- Jsonformer fills in the fixed tokens during the generation process and only delegates the generation of content tokens to the language model, making it more efficient and bulletproof than existing approaches.
- Jsonformer is built on top of the HuggingFace transformers library and supports a subset of JSON schema while being flexible and extendable.

### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35790092)

- Other similar JSON schema generators like Clownfish and Guardrails require a more complex approach for complex schemas
- Zod can be used for defining expected type and validating response, matching inferred static types like Typescript after 'transmogrify'
