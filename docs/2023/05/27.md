### [Evidence that the shingles vaccine prevents a good chunk of dementia cases](https://twitter.com/PGeldsetzer1/status/1661776663074738176)

- The shingles vaccine has been found to have a protective effect against dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.
- The study analyzed electronic health records and found that getting vaccinated reduces the chances of a dementia diagnosis by a fifth over a seven-year follow-up period.
- The study also found that the vaccine has no effect on other common causes of morbidity or mortality, and that it has a stronger protective effect on women compared to men. Further research is needed to determine the exact effect size and optimal population groups and time interval for vaccination, as well as to understand how the vaccine prevents or delays dementia.
