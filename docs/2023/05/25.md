### [Simple exercise to eliminate gastroesophageal reflux (2022)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9106553/)

- A case report outlines a novel exercise for resistance training of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to eliminate gastroesophageal reflux.
- The exercise requires swallowing food in a kneeling position with the head bowed lower than the stomach, providing resistance against gravity for the LES.
- After several months of daily repetitions, symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux ceased and the exercise was discontinued without relapse, indicating potential permanent solutions for the problem.

- The article discusses a "squat and gulp" exercise that may help alleviate GERD symptoms, though caution is advised due to potential risks.
- Alternative remedies such as yoga poses, breathing exercises, and sodium alginate have also been successful for some individuals, while medications like PPIs can have negative side effects.

### [The long road to recover Frogger 2 source from tape drives](https://github.com/Kneesnap/onstream-data-recovery/blob/main/info/INTRO.MD)

- The author shares their story of recovering the source code for the game Frogger 2 from an OnStream tape drive.
- Finding a compatible tape drive was the first challenge, and a professional data recovery company worsened the situation.
- With months of effort and reverse engineering, the author was able to extract the data from the tape, but had to overcome challenges with proprietary file formats and undocumented tape drive features.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36061574)

- Difficulty in recovering data from tape backups due to lack of cataloging and indexing
- Older technologies still valid in the future, but preserving software and data is difficult
- Thread on Discussion Service discusses challenges of long-term data retention and archival storage, recommends using multiple formats and technologies

### [Don't open the details in a modal window, have it be a separate page](https://youdontneedamodalwindow.dev/)

- Using a modal window for detailed content is not necessary. Instead, use a separate page.
- Modal windows can't be bookmarked or shared as links, and opening them in a new tab can be confusing.
- Modal windows can be difficult to implement accurately and may not always be the best choice. Consider alternatives and ensure your web app passes the "refresh test.".

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36056376)

- The article discusses the use cases and potential issues with modal windows in UI design, suggesting that they should be used only for specific tasks like alerts and forms.
- Accessibility is an important consideration when designing modal windows, not just for screen readers but for other features like zooming and focus/reader modes.
- There is a debate among developers about the usefulness and potential downsides of modal windows, with some arguing that they can be confusing and others advocating for their use in certain situations.

### [SectorC: A C Compiler in 512 bytes](https://xorvoid.com/sectorc.html)

- SectorC is a C compiler written in x86-16 assembly that fits within the 512 byte boot sector of an x86 machine, likely the smallest C compiler ever written.
- Despite its small size, SectorC supports a subset of C that is large enough to write real and interesting programs, including global variables, functions, if statements, while statements, lots of operators, pointer dereference, inline machine-code, comments, and more.
- SectorC implements a minimalist lexer and parser and utilizes the hash function of atoi to minimize code size, allowing it to become a proper C.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36064971)

- SectorC is a C-subset compiler using only 512 bytes of x86 assembly, demonstrating the value of questioning common assumptions.
- JIT compiling to machine instructions and executing the compiled output allows for more optimizations than AOT compilers, and is used in some languages like Javascript and as a dynamic analogue for profile-guided optimization.
- A discussion on Hacker News explores the potential uses of the Bootstrap Project, a tool to deploy a C compiler in a virtual machine, including in deep-space applications and for smaller microcontrollers, with debate over the use of structs in this minimal environment.

### How do you not take criticism of your work personally?

- A member of the Hacker News (Discussion Service) community asked how to avoid taking criticism of their work personally.
- Many Discussion Service users shared their own experiences and techniques for dealing with criticism.
- The discussion focused on separating personal value from the value of the work and learning from feedback without letting it affect one's self-worth.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36056299)

- It is normal to take constructive criticism personally, but developing an anti-fragile attitude can help handle it better and become a better human being from it.
- Detaching self-worth from output or delivery, assuming positive intentions, practicing self-reflection, and focusing on self-compassion can help handle negative feedback in a professional setting.
- Recognizing poor feedback, striving towards company goals, and owning up to mistakes while anticipating criticism with optimism lead to personal and professional growth in the software industry.

### [Walking naturally after spinal cord injury using a brainâ€“spine interface](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06094-5)

- Scientists have developed a brain-spine interface that allowed three spinal-cord-injured patients to walk again with natural and balanced gaits.
- The interface involves recording signals from the brain using implantable sensors and decoding them to electrical stimulation of the muscles in the legs via an electrode patch on the skin worn on the lower back.
- The three individuals were able to walk with training and some assistance, with the effort being similar to walking with leg braces after years of paralysis.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36059429)

- A digital brain-spine interface allowed a patient with spinal cord injury to walk unassisted
- The technology restores movement to people with complete spinal cord injuries
- The authors expressed confidence that it can be applied to a broad population of individuals with paralysis

### [Hypersonic missiles are misunderstood](https://medium.com/@ToryBrunoULA/hypersonic-missiles-are-just-misunderstood-1a35c8ae3dd0)

- Hypersonic missiles are not new, and we have had them for decades.
- The real problem with hypersonic missiles is that they are maneuverable, making them challenging to intercept using traditional missile defense systems designed for ballistic threats.
- Directed Energy (DE), like lasers, could be a potential solution for intercepting maneuverable hypersonic missiles due to their high speed and a battle space that covers the entire field of regard of the laser.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36057675)

- The article discusses the potential use of lasers from satellites to destroy hypersonic missiles, but there is skepticism about the cost and complexity of deployment, as well as concerns about the weaponization of space.
- The effectiveness of missile defense systems like Patriot in intercepting incoming targets is debated, with some arguing for a strong defense and others pointing out limitations.
- Experts discuss recent technological advances in military lasers and their potential uses, but there are also caveats and limitations to consider, such as the effectiveness against plasma shields and the prohibition of weapon deployment in space.
