### [Health officials delayed report linking fluoride to brain harm](https://www.salon.com/2023/03/16/health-officials-delayed-report-linking-fluoride-to-brain-harm_partner/)

- A long-awaited report by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) on the possible cognitive and neurodevelopmental impacts of fluoride exposure in humans was delayed by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) after criticism from health and dental organizations advocating for community water fluoridation.
- The report found that a link between typical levels of fluoride added to water and possible harm to brain development is unclear, but it did find a possible link to cognitive harm at approximately two times the current recommended water fluoridation level.
- Experts suggest that current water fluoridation levels may potentially be unsafe for developing fetuses and young children, as many common foods and drinks also contain fluoride.

### [ARM's Cortex A53: Tiny but Important](https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/05/28/arms-cortex-a53-tiny-but-important/)

- ARM's Cortex A53 is a low-power CPU, optimized for power efficiency and non-CPU sensitive tasks.
- A53's design is achieved through smaller, less power-hungry caches, and in-order execution.
- A53's strength can be seen in its widespread use in the mobile market and in various low-power applications after its days in cell phone SoCs.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36102406)

- Cortex A53 microarchitecture has remained largely unchanged for over a decade and is used in millions of phones worldwide.
- Newer and less power-efficient designs, Cortex-A7x and Cortex-X, are now the focus, while SiFive's U74 and XuanTie C910 show that Cortex-A57 has been surpassed in performance, power, and area.
- Article also discusses the design goals of Cortex-A55 and Cortex-A510, intended to be paired with big and medium-size cores, prioritizing improved ISA's and design enhancements that lead to greater performance.

### [The Gemini protocol seen by this HTTP client person](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/05/28/the-gemini-protocol-seen-by-this-http-client-person/)

- Gemini is a new wire protocol and documentation format emerging from a movement against developments considered wrong on the current web.
- Gemini has been designed to reduce surveillance and tracking by eliminating cookies, negotiations, authentication, and compression, using instead TLS client certificates for keeping state between requests.
- The protocol is minimalist, not visually attractive to users, and lacks the power to accomplish many things possible on the current web, but is expected to allow more server and client implementations.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36104533)

- Gemini protocol is a new minimal markup format for text documents, aimed to offer an alternative to the complicated and centralized modern web.
- The protocol focuses on privacy, performance, and ease of implementation, and replaces HTML with basic text-format supporting simple design.
- The use of TLS and mandatory secure connections limits Gemini's adoption by hobbyists and devices, and features like POST are blocked, but Gemini is gaining popularity among hobbyists who enjoy playing with a protocol that doesn't have to deal with ads and tracking.
