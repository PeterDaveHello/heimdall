## [Performance Boost: Splitting Structs Above 16 Bytes on AMD64](https://gist.github.com/FeepingCreature/5dff669aad380a123b15659e195fb96c)

- Passing structs larger than 16 bytes on AMD64 can significantly slow down code execution.
- Changing arrays to be passed as three separate pointer parameters instead of one struct parameter improved the performance of the Neat language by a factor of two.
- This improvement is due to the fact that structs larger than 16 bytes are passed by pointer in the SystemV AMD64 ABI specification, resulting in extra stack rearrangement for function calls. By passing arrays as separate pointer parameters, the values are already in SSE registers and do not need to be loaded from the stack, resulting in faster execution.
