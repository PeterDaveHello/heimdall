## [Why is Chile so long?](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/why-is-chile-so-long)

- Chile's unique length is due to the Andes mountains, creating a narrow strip of land between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean.
- The country's geography is shaped by the collision of the Nazca and South American tectonic plates, forming the Andes.
- Chile's borders were historically contested, notably in the War of the Pacific, where it gained resource-rich territories.
