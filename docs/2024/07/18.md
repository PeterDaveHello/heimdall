- The technology promises a significant boost in pixel density and manufacturing efficiency, but it faces challenges like color consistency, brightness control, and the inability to produce certain colors like white and magenta without additional techniques like dithering.
- This development is particularly exciting for applications requiring high pixel density, such as VR headsets, but it may not yet be suitable for general-purpose displays due to its current limitations.

## [Closed form arc length parametrization is impossible for quadratic BÃ©zier curves](https://ninjakoa.la/curly_curves/posts/quadratic_bezier_arc_length_parametrization/)

- BÃ©zier curves are fundamental in vector graphics, defined using control points in the Bernstein basis.
- Quadratic BÃ©zier curves use three control points, and their arc length can be computed exactly, but the parametrization lacks a closed form solution, assuming Schanuel's conjecture.
- Cubic BÃ©zier curves use four control points, and their arc length must be computed numerically as it lacks a closed form.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40991075)

- Closed form arc length parametrization is not feasible for quadratic BÃ©zier curves; numerical solutions are preferred for their stability and accuracy.
- Although closed form solutions can be faster, they tend to become unstable, particularly for curves near a straight line.
- Numerical methods are generally superior and more practical for most applications, despite the existence of Pythagorean-Hodograph curves and Euler spirals.
