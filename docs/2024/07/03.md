## [Why Bridges Don't Sink](https://practical.engineering/blog/2024/7/2/why-bridges-dont-sink)

- Bridges must support loads over clear spaces, requiring strong substructures like piers or abutments to handle concentrated forces.
- Foundation piles, driven deep into the ground, provide stability through end-bearing and skin friction, resisting vertical and horizontal loads.
- Alternatives like drilled shafts and variations such as continuous flight auger piles and helical piles address specific geotechnical challenges, though all methods have limitations and potential failure risks.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40861520)

- Bridges remain stable because driven piles are tested for the force required to install them, ensuring they can handle significant loads.
- Wooden piles, when preserved in fully soaked ground, can last for centuries, as evidenced by structures in Venice and New Orleans.
- Challenges such as soil liquefaction, lateral deflection, and unexpected underground conditions can complicate pile driving, but innovative engineering solutions, like floating bridges and historical examples like the Brooklyn Bridge, demonstrate successful overcoming of these issues.
