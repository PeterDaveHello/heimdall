## [Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed](https://twitter.com/patrickwardle/status/1814343502886477857)

- CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed due to a faulting instruction involving an invalid memory address.
- The issue was caused by an unmapped address from an array of pointers, leading to a crash when accessing memory.
- The specific faulting instruction was "mov r9d, [r8]," where R8 held the invalid address.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41021366)

- CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crash was caused by bad binary data and a poorly-written parser that failed to handle invalid data correctly.
- The incident was worsened by poorly written kernel code, lack of internal testing, ignored update settings, simultaneous global rollout, and initial data corruption.
- This highlights the need for robust error handling, staggered deployments, and thorough testing, including fuzz testing, to prevent similar failures.

## [What is the significance of the character "j" at the end of a Roman Numeral? (2013)](https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/questions/3748/what-is-the-significance-of-the-character-j-at-the-end-of-a-roman-numeral)
