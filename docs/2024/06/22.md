## [Own Constant Folder in C/C++](https://www.neilhenning.dev/posts/yourownconstantfolder/)

- Using the `sqrtps` intrinsic in C/C++ with clang's `-ffast-math` flag can lead to precision issues as it replaces `sqrtps` with `rsqrtps`.
- Inline assembly can enforce the use of `sqrtps`, but it doesn't support constant folding when the function is inlined.
- To ensure both constant folding and correct behavior, use `__builtin_constant_p` to check if the vector is constant and apply `_mm_sqrt_ps` accordingly.
