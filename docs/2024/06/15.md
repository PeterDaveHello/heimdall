## [Django SQLite Production Config](https://blog.pecar.me/sqlite-django-config)

- The default SQLite configuration in Django is not suitable for production due to its low-concurrency optimization, which contrasts with Django's needs.
- For Django versions 5.0, 4.2, or older, enabling WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) journal mode can improve concurrency by preventing write requests from blocking reads.
- Django 5.1, expected in August 2024, will allow these SQLite optimizations to be configured directly in settings.py, simplifying the process for developers.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40688336)

- Django SQLite Production Config has a significant issue with SQLite in WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode, where the WAL file can grow excessively under high load, potentially causing system failure.
- A workaround involves running a separate thread to monitor the WAL size and slow down reads and writes if it exceeds 8 MB, but this suggests SQLite in WAL mode may not be suitable for production environments.
- PostgreSQL is recommended for most small to medium projects due to its better handling of high-volume transactions and fewer limitations compared to SQLite.
