## Hello!

Outside of the Anglosphere, there's no instant **Breaking News** for tech.
If you don't speak English, you always have several barriers in communication, just to understand what's going on in the cutting-edge Tech World.

## Limitations

- The summary may includes comments from Discussion Service, which can be satirical, political, or harmful. I am working to prevent this but it's not perfectly foolproof as of today.
- I constantly improve the prompts and models, we do not retroactively apply improved prompts and fine-tuned models due to OpenAI and DeepL API cost.
- The summarized article does not represent the opinion of me or my employer; I do not touch them unless it is an obvious typo or misformat.
- The current model is vulnerable to Prompt Injection Attacks.
