### Tardigrades' Survival Secret: Desiccation Tolerance Protein.

- Tardigrades, or water bears, have the ability to survive extreme conditions due to their genes producing a desiccation tolerance protein (TDP) that protects their cells from dehydration during extreme desiccation.
- Scientists hope to use tardigrades' genes to make more drought-resistant plants and crops.
- Tardigrades use a process called vitrification, turning themselves into a "glass" state, which preserves cellular structures until they can rehydrate. Specific proteins enable the transition into this "glass" state, potentially useful for medical purposes such as organ preservation.
- Concerns have been raised about the potential for the research to be used maliciously, resulting in pandemics with desiccation-tolerant bacteria.

### Limitations of Docker-Compose with Kubernetes: Exploring Alternatives & Solutions

- Developers are discussing the limitations of Docker-compose with Kubernetes and exploring alternative solutions for creating infrastructure using code.
- Some suggest using established languages for configuration and stripping the runtime to a minimal set of features, while others propose using higher-level abstractions or importing JSON files into actual programming languages for dynamically parameterizing configurations.
- The author suggests using simple abstractions like Nix or defining as a common python value and caution against using Docker-Compose.yaml files, which can be lacking in key information.
- Ergomake believes that docker-compose.yml can be used as a universal infrastructure language for Kubernetes, allowing developers to use higher-level abstraction formats if they do not need the level of control that Kubernetes manifests offer.
- Decoupling interfaces from implementations is crucial, and the future lies in developers building value on top of standardized APIs, leading to fewer platform engineers and more creativity and innovation.

### Defaulting to Multi-Page Apps for Better UX & Website Building

- Defaulting to Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) can provide a better user experience by using page-to-page prerendering and offer benefits such as accessibility, inclusivity, energy efficiency, privacy, and improved SEO rankings.

- Single-Page Applications (SPAs) have some performance advantages, but large JavaScript bundles can impede site performance, and they require additional framework support for page-to-page prerendering.

- Vue offers alternatives to heavyweight state management paradigms with reactive() and ref(), while Lit, snabbdom, and Svelte can accomplish event binding and setting attributes without state management.

- The shift to SPAs happened because of mobile browsing and increased website complexity, but SPAs have some drawbacks and may have been adopted due to hype or cargo-culting.

- The ongoing debate over SPA versus MPA involves issues such as screen reader compatibility, upgrading all-in-one frameworks, and the benefits of View Transition API or Predictive Prefetching for SPA-like benefits without drawbacks.

- Next.js has good Core Web Vitals for improved website performance, and alternatives like Quicklink can speed up navigations, but there are trade-offs to consider.

- Jake Archibald and Manuel Matuzović offer their perspectives on SPA drawbacks, while Netflix functions without TypeScript, and Eleventy's creator has given 63 talks and automated Open Graph images through his site.

### Qatar's Covert Smear Campaign against American Trader Exposed by Hackers

- American commodities trader Hazim Nada was the target of a covert smear campaign, likely initiated by Qatar, which ultimately destroyed his business. In 2019, hackers provided Nada with terabytes of files exposing the campaign against him, revealing the sources of the lies and firms that spread them, including private intelligence firms.
- False allegations of terrorism and money laundering led to the collapse of Nada's oil-trading business after World-Check, a database that banks rely on to vet customers, listed him and his company under the "Terrorism" risk category, causing five financial institutions to walk away. Despite having his name cleared and sanctions lifted, Nada's father, who ran an Islamic bank, also faced similar accusations and sanctions until 2015.
- Private investigator Nicolas Brero, who operates a Swiss private intelligence company called Alp Services, may have worked for multiple governments and wealthy clients, conducting espionage and selling call histories and information acquired by illegal means. One of his notable clients was Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the ruler of the UAE, whom he conducted a smear campaign against Qatar for in exchange for millions of dollars.
- Leaked documents reveal that the UAE hired a computer hacker to orchestrate cyberattacks against Qatar, with the hacker working alongside private companies, state institutions, and analysts involved in the feud. The documents also reveal a plan to discredit pro-Qatar and Muslim Brotherhood figures.
- Brero, along with a range of journalists and scholars who received payments, worked on behalf of the UAE to attack human rights advocates and other perceived enemies through a mixture of surveillance and propaganda tactics. Unknown hackers broke into Alp's systems and gained access to files connected to 17 targets, including Swiss billionaire Jean-Pierre Nada.
