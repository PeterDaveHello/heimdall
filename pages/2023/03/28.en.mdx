### Critics Slam Apple's Icloud Keychain for Limitations and Poor User Experience

Users criticize Apple's iCloud Keychain for poor user experience on Windows and limitations on Mac, such as being tied to Safari and difficulty finding Passwords settings. Lack of integration with Keychain and Apple's password management tools on Windows is reported, and Passkeys is seen as offering little improvement.

Apple may benefit from putting more weight behind a cross-platform toolkit to support services growth. Overall, the article offers a mixed assessment of Apple's password management system and its compatibility with other browsers. Users recommend alternative password managers such as Bitwarden or 1Password, which offer more robust features, including the ability to share passwords among family members. Users emphasize the importance of good password hygiene and highlight the convenience and security benefits of using a password manager. Some users suggest that Apple should release a standalone app for passwords, accessible from a toolbar icon in Safari and equipped with a full UI.

### Eu Surveillance Proposal Violates Privacy, Better Solutions Needed

A proposal by a Swedish VPN provider that would force politicians in EU countries to submit to continuous 24/7 audio and video surveillance is not suitable for a democratic society and violates an individual's right to privacy. The EU should look at alternative measures to increase transparency and accountability, such as lobbying reforms and expanding access to information, instead of implementing extreme surveillance measures. The discussion includes the lack of trust in politicians and the need for more transparency in their decision-making, with suggestions ranging from personal scrutiny to implementing systems similar to code reviews. The article discusses broken government processes in terms of information processing and proposes solutions such as greater transparency, intensive monitoring of politicians, and Athenian-style ostracism by public vote. The proposal by the EU to ban end-to-end encryption and require companies to scan all content for illegal material infringes on privacy and free speech, according to critics. The concept of "Door in the face" is discussed in relation to political negotiations and the potential for extremist policy proposals to make more moderate ones seem palatable. The democratic deficit in the EU is a concern for some, with concerns raised about the autocratic nature of the European Commission and the dilution of democracy when the electorate becomes too large and diverse.
