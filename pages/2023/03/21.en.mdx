### [Web fingerprinting is worse than I thought](https://www.bitestring.com/posts/2023-03-19-web-fingerprinting-is-worse-than-I-thought.html?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- Web fingerprinting is a technique used by websites to identify and track individual users through the use of information on their web browser and device configuration, without relying on cookies or other persistent storage.
- Fingerprinting is sold as a service to e-commerce websites for fraud prevention and website security.
- This article details how a company called FingerprintJS is selling fingerprinting as a service to other websites, and presents tests demonstrating the efficacy of fingerprinting and best strategies for protecting against it.
- Using Tor Browser or Firefox with resistFingerprinting=true provides more protection than using Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome or Brave.
- VPNs do not offer protection against fingerprinting.

- Adobe has unveiled Firefly, a creative generative AI model that lets users generate a range of creative designs and settings using everyday language.
- Users can upload graphics to generate poster and banner designs, experiment with different edits on videos, mix elements of two or more photos and eventually create 3D models.
- Firefly will be integrated into Adobe Creative Cloud and aims to significantly enhance creativity by offering generative AI tools that cater to the creative community's needs and workflows.
- Adobe has committed to developing creative generative AI in a responsible way and is working to stand up for accountability, responsibility, and transparency in generative AI through the Content Authenticity Initiative and Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity.

### [Asahi Linux releases updated GPU driver with improved performance and compatibility](https://asahilinux.org/2023/03/road-to-vulkan/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- The Asahi Linux team has released version 0.3 of its GPU driver, which includes huge performance improvements, improved compatibility with Mesa, and explicit sync support, thereby increasing CPU-GPU parallelism.
- Asahi Linux has been working on open-source GPU drivers for Apple Silicon for the past year and recently designed a userspace API for each class of GPU, which is the interface between the kernel and userspace parts of the driver.
- The batch tracking system was developed to handle the submission of batches that aren't active but are submitted to increase efficiency.
- The new driver also supports multi-VM, multi-job submission, ability to execute compute shaders, and includes stub support for blit commands, while memory safety bugs in the DRM scheduler component have been fixed.

### [DPReview.com, a popular photography review website, is set to close](https://www.dpreview.com/news/5901145460/dpreview-com-to-close?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- Users can request a download of all their uploaded content until 6 April.
- The website's editorial team will continue to work on reviews and aims to deliver some of its best-ever content before closing down.
- DPReview has been providing informative content, reviews, and news for photographers around the world for nearly 25 years.
- DPReview published a list of the most popular point-and-shoot cameras rented out by camera and lens rental company Lensrentals, revealing that smartphones with advanced camera systems may have made the concept of "point-and-shoot" cameras obsolete. However, some photographers still prefer the simplicity and reliability of dedicated cameras.

### [Mailchimp blacklists users who open the browser's dev tools](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35235732&ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- MailChimp users have reported being blocked from their accounts after opening their browser's dev tools while editing emails.
- Commenters noted that the ban might be related to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities caused by the use of unescaped or malformed HTML in the console or to APIs interacting with the system's web application firewall.
- Some speculated that Mailchimp was trying to prevent users from inspecting email templates or reverse-engineering email campaigns or that the blocking mechanism was to prevent users from using ad-blockers.
- The issue has raised concerns about restrictions on development tools and the implications for developers, who may be denied essential tools for their work by overly aggressive or cautious security mechanisms.

### [Petals allows collaborative use of 100B+ language models](https://petals.ml/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- Petals allows collaborative use of large language models (e.g. BLOOM-176B) by loading a small part of the model and teaming up with others serving the other parts.
- Users can run inference or fine-tuning, with single-batch inference running at ≈ 1 sec per token, and parallel inference reaching hundreds of tokens/sec.
- Petals offers more flexibility than classic language model APIs, with the ability to employ any fine-tuning and sampling methods, execute custom paths through the model, or see its hidden states. It uses PyTorch for added flexibility.
- Currently on a waitlist, but users can try it in ColabDocs on GitHub or join the Discord channel to follow its development.

### [So you've installed `fzf` – now what?](https://andrew-quinn.me/fzf/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

- Fzf is a command line tool that enables fuzzy finding of files and directories.
- Keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+R and Alt+C can improve search efficiency.
- Fzf can be used in combination with other UNIX tools like grep and vi for an improved searching experience.
- Pairing fzf with rg, a fast recursive grep tool, can provide even quicker searches.
