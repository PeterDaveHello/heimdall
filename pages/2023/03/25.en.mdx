### GitHub Updates RSA SSH Host Key Following Exposure

- GitHub updates RSA SSH host key after private key exposed in public repository
- Customers using ECDSA or Ed25519 keys do not need to take action, but those using RSA need to update their ~/.ssh/known_hosts file
- GitHub has yet to introduce a mechanism for revoking SSH keys, which could be a potential issue if compromised
- Having a real-world risk/threat model is crucial for building reasonable security controls
- Git authors should sign their commits with their own private key for code integrity, rather than trusting hosting providers
- GitHub accidentally published its key, undermining the principle of trust and leaving all communications since its inception compromised
- GitHub is encouraging improvements to certificates used for logging into code repositories
- GitHub and GitLab both support two-factor authentication (2FA) via their command line interfaces (CLI)
- The recent incident highlights potential security flaws in many fintech companies, including blind trust in GitHub host keys
- GitHub briefly exposed a private key due to an accident, but took proactive measures to revoke and redeploy new keys and certificates, and implement enhanced controls.

### Banking Crisis Differs from 2008: 3 Reasons Why

- The current banking crisis differs from the 2008 financial crisis in several ways according to Chase Bank. 
- Firstly, banks are currently stronger financially with more capital available. 
- Secondly, the current economic downturn is caused by a specific external event (COVID-19) rather than being due to fundamental weaknesses in the financial system. 
- Finally, the response from central banks and governments to the crisis is more coordinated and aggressive than in 2008.

### Server-Side WebAssembly: Tug-of-War Between Platforms and WASI

- There is a tug-of-war over the future of server-side WebAssembly, with two competing visions.
- One side sees Wasm as an extension of the web platform, while the other side sees it as a CPU-independent bytecode with its own syscall interface (WASI).
- The web platform side runs Wasm in a JavaScript runtime with a bespoke ABI that exposes relevant browser APIs.
- The WASI side uses a runtime that implements the WASI syscall interface to provide a POSIX-inspired ABI.
- Currently, most WASI calls are thin wrappers around OS syscalls that provide access to stdio, filesystems, the system clock, and random number generation.
- Vendors provide their own ABIs to fill gaps in WASI's capabilities, but this makes Wasm code bound to specific platforms.
- The Wasm component model may force standardization and replace proprietary ABIs with standard component interfaces.
- The author is optimistic about the WASI/component side and hopes that WASI will cover enough of libc to allow existing libraries to be compiled to it without major rewrites.

### Nintendo Closes Wii U and 3DS Stores, Threatening Game Preservation

- Nintendo is closing its Wii U and 3DS digital storefronts, marking a loss of digital art for gamers and threatening the preservation of classic titles.
- Fans, collectors, and content creators have expressed concerns that classic games will no longer be widely available or easily accessible as official channels for purchasing them disappear.
- While emulation and FPGA-based solutions can preserve the technology required to play older games, Kelsey Lewin of the Video Game History Foundation believes that "the future of game preservation is in making sure we're considering more than the literal games themselves," including their cultural context and community aspects.
- As the closure of the eShops looms, some enthusiasts have embarked on preservation efforts by collecting every available game or donating hardware and software to organizations like the Video Game History Foundation.

### Venture Capitalists Under Scrutiny for Alternative Models and Regulation

- Venture capitalists are under scrutiny for their role in society and the recent investor meltdown surrounding Silicon Valley Bank.
- Alternative models are needed to prioritize the interests of people and greater scrutiny and regulation should be implemented, with restrictions for investing from public entities and pension funds, and required audits for companies with over $10 million in revenue.
- Democracy and capitalism have flaws and do not eliminate the accumulation of power by the wealthy, but it is important to strive for more long-term thinking and a focus on progress for future generations.
- The investment structure of the venture capital system rewards a small group of individuals hugely at a punishing cost to others, and venture capitalists are not inherently good for society despite the value of entrepreneurship and startup creation.
- Founders, not VCs, made the decisions about where their companies kept their cash and were the ones who panicked and started discussions of moving their money out of Silicon Valley Bank.

### Let's Encrypt Launches ARI for Improved Resiliency and Reliability

- Let's Encrypt has launched ACME Renewal Information (ARI) in production to improve resiliency and reliability for subscribers in handling certificate revocation and renewal.
- ARI allows Let's Encrypt to signal to ACME clients when to renew certificates, even in case of unexpected revocation, without disrupting subscriber services.
- ARI can also help modulate renewals to avoid load spikes on Let's Encrypt infrastructure and set subscribers up for success in ideal renewal times in case of shorter-lived certificates in the future.
- ARI has been standardized in the IETF and Let's Encrypt plans to help with ACME client support in the coming months.
- Let's Encrypt depends on contributions from its community and welcomes individual and organizational donations and sponsorships to support its public benefit services.

### Subterranean Biosphere Twice as Large as Oceans Discovered

- A vast biosphere has been discovered beneath the Earth's surface, nearly twice as big as Earth's oceans and containing 23 billion tons of organisms.
- The biosphere, also known as the "subterranean Galapagos," is made up of microbes that can live miles beneath land and seafloor habitats.
- The Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), a collaboration between 1,000 scientists studying "deep Earth" ecosystems, discovered the biosphere by sampling hundreds of deep Earth habitats, sometimes drilling boreholes three miles deep to reach them.
- The discovery of this biosphere could help us understand the origins and evolution of life on our planet, as well as the potential for extraterrestrial life.

### Overview: glibc malloc Memory Allocation in Linux

- The article provides an overview of the glibc malloc memory allocator, including its history, system calls, threading support, arenas, and multiple heaps.
- The per thread arena approach enhances memory allocator and application performance, with separate heap segments and freelist data structures for each thread.
- The glibc malloc library uses fast, unsorted, small, and large bins to hold different sizes of free memory chunks.
- Chunks of memory are split and coalesced, and memory is allocated based on requested size and additional space needed for metadata and alignment.
- Multi-threaded scenarios can lead to contention and performance issues, and mmap is used to allocate large chunks of memory.
- Manipulating heap chunks can be done through various allocation and deallocation functions, and there are bins for performance optimization.
- Unsorted chunks can be merged to form new chunks, and free chunks can be consolidated to prevent fragmentation.

### DIY Internet Skull Status Indicator

- DIY Internet Skull Status Indicator project created to monitor internet connection and display status using a skull with LED eyes.
- The project uses an Arduino Nano 33 IoT, RGB LEDs, and resistors to indicate when the internet is connected (green eyes) or disconnected (red eyes).
- The code was built using the WiFiNINA library and connects to a reliable website through Wi-Fi to check internet status.
- The skull enclosure was painted with a green hammertone finish but could be repainted a different color in the future.
- Overall, the project is a helpful and creative idea for monitoring internet connectivity.
