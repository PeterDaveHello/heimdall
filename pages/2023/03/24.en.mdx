### [OpenAI Introduces Plugins for Enhanced ChatGPT Functionality](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins)

- OpenAI has introduced plugins for its ChatGPT platform, enabling developers to connect to additional data sources and third-party applications
- The plugins allow language models to access and retrieve up-to-date information, while also running computations and utilizing third-party services
- Currently, the functionality is only available to a select group of users, but OpenAI plans to expand access for other developers in the future
- Developers on OpenAI's waitlist will be able to design plugins for ChatGPT and make them available in the platform's prompt
- The plugins offer opportunities for customisation and various functions, such as text summarisation and translation, and have the potential to expand OpenAI's capabilities.

### [FTC Proposes Ban on Tough-to-Cancel Subscriptions](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652373/ftc-click-to-cancel-subscription-service-dark-patterns-ban)

- The US Federal Trade Commission is proposing a "click to cancel" rule that would require companies to make ending a subscription as simple as signing up.
- Companies must offer an up-front opt-out that lets customers bypass sales pitches and annually remind consumers that they're enrolled in "negative option" programs.
- The proposed ban aims to prevent companies from manipulating consumers into paying for unwanted subscriptions.
- The FTC can recover around $50,000 per individual violation of a consumer's rights and demand restitution from companies that break the rule.
- The agency is seeking public comments on the proposal before making revisions and passing the final regulation.

### [Nigerian entrepreneur exposes election fraud with AI PDF conversion](https://markessien.com/posts/drama_of_transcription/)

- Nigerian entrepreneur, Mark Essien, used machine learning to convert PDFs of the 2023 Presidential elections in Nigeria into spreadsheets and structured JSON data.
- The converted data allowed the opposition party to uncover an alleged vote-rigging scheme by the ruling All Progressives Congress.
- Mark Essien's tool can also extract data from invoices, contracts, and bank statements.
- This episode underlines the potential of open-data collaboration to monitor election activities and promote transparency.

### [OpenAI's Closed Policies Hinder Language Model Reproducibility](https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/openais-policies-hinder-reproducible)

- OpenAI's closed policies on their language models hinder reproducible research, which is a cornerstone in scientific research.
- Access to the exact model used in an experiment is a prerequisite for reproducible research, and OpenAI only maintains these snapshots for three months.
- OpenAI's hasty deprecation of Codex falls short of standard practices for deprecating software, and researchers had less than a week to shift to using another model before OpenAI deprecated Codex.
- OpenAI's deprecation also impacts commercial applications that rely on a certain model for classification, as users would need to reclassify everything from scratch if they switch models.
- OpenAI needs to take responsibility for maintaining language model infrastructure, as it is a key piece of infrastructure relied upon by researchers and developers.
- Open-sourcing language models would aid reproducibility, as researchers would have access to the model instead of relying on tech companies like OpenAI.

### [Mathematicians Find Single Shape for Aperiodic Tiling](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2365363-mathematicians-discover-shape-that-can-tile-a-wall-and-never-repeat/)

- Mathematicians have discovered a single shape that can be used to tile a surface without ever repeating, known as aperiodic tiling.
- The shape is surprisingly simple but has taken decades to uncover and has potential applications in material science and decorating.
- Traditionally, simple shapes like squares and equilateral triangles could tile a surface in a repeating pattern with no gaps.

### [Block accused of fraud, facilitating crime, and predatory practices](https://hindenburgresearch.com/block/)

- Block (formerly known as Square) has been accused by Hindenburg Research of facilitating fraud against consumers and the government.
- Hindenburg also alleges that Cash App has a significant fraud problem and is guilty of fraud against consumers and governments.
- Block has been accused of embracing criminal elements in the "underbanked" population and suppressing internal concerns about fraud to grow its user base.
- Block has been accused of dressing up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary products, avoiding regulation, and failing to embrace necessary compliance policies.
- Block's revenue declined 1% in 2022 compared to the prior year, and its reliance on non-GAAP adjustments to report profit has increased over time.

### [Juicing: Enhancing Player Experience Through Non-Essential Effects](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/design/juice)

- Juice refers to non-essential visual, audio, and haptic effects that enhance a player's experience and reinforce game objectives.
- Juicing involves providing bountiful user feedback and a sense of control to make the player feel powerful.
- Designers must prioritize emotional needs and ask how to make the user feel to create a soulful experience.
- Examples of juicing include button hover that shows keyboard shortcuts, using tweening for animations, and triggering scripted sequences to teach and entertain in video games.
- Players should always blame themselves for failure in video games as it encourages them to try harder.
- Rewarding players with treats like special effects or sequences also encourages them to continue playing.
- Juicing can also be used outside of video games, such as the use of a map and labelled locations in the title sequence of Game of Thrones to help viewers understand geography and remember previous events.
