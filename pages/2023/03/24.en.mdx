### [OpenAI's Closed Policies Hinder Language Model Reproducibility](https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/openais-policies-hinder-reproducible)

- OpenAI's closed policies on their language models hinder reproducible research, which is a cornerstone in scientific research.
- Access to the exact model used in an experiment is a prerequisite for reproducible research, and OpenAI only maintains these snapshots for three months.
- OpenAI's hasty deprecation of Codex falls short of standard practices for deprecating software, and researchers had less than a week to shift to using another model before OpenAI deprecated Codex.
- OpenAI's deprecation also impacts commercial applications that rely on a certain model for classification, as users would need to reclassify everything from scratch if they switch models.
- OpenAI needs to take responsibility for maintaining language model infrastructure, as it is a key piece of infrastructure relied upon by researchers and developers.
- Open-sourcing language models would aid reproducibility, as researchers would have access to the model instead of relying on tech companies like OpenAI.

### [Juicing: Enhancing Player Experience Through Non-Essential Effects](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/design/juice)

- Juice refers to non-essential visual, audio, and haptic effects that enhance a player's experience and reinforce game objectives.
- Juicing involves providing bountiful user feedback and a sense of control to make the player feel powerful.
- Designers must prioritize emotional needs and ask how to make the user feel to create a soulful experience.
- Examples of juicing include button hover that shows keyboard shortcuts, using tweening for animations, and triggering scripted sequences to teach and entertain in video games.
- Players should always blame themselves for failure in video games as it encourages them to try harder.
- Rewarding players with treats like special effects or sequences also encourages them to continue playing.
- Juicing can also be used outside of video games, such as the use of a map and labelled locations in the title sequence of Game of Thrones to help viewers understand geography and remember previous events.

### [Read Hacker News threads with latest comments first](https://til.simonwillison.net/hacker-news/recent-comments)

- Hacker News displays comments in a tree, which can make it frustrating to keep track of a conversation.
- One solution is to use the Algolia search functionality provided by Hacker News's API to filter for comments and order by date, resulting in the most recent comments being displayed at the top of the page.
- Another solution involves using the Algolia Hacker News API and loading the JSON results into Datasette Lite, a browser-based version of Datasette, which offers more options for displaying and filtering the results.
- A more complex solution involves using SQLite's JSON functions and json_tree() function to flatten nested JSON objects containing the comments, which is then loaded into Datasette for display and filtering.
- A previous solution involved using the hacker-news-to-sqlite CLI tool to store comments and sort them chronologically using SQLite and Datasette.

### [Migrating Rust Codebase from Cargo to Bazel Build System](https://mmapped.blog/posts/17-scaling-rust-builds-with-bazel.html)

- Internet Computer repository migrated from Cargo to Bazel as the primary build system due to limitations of Cargo as the project size increased
- Cargo is not a build system and has poor caching and dependency tracking
- Bazel was chosen for its extensibility and aggressive caching, among other features
- Migration process took several months, involving creating a prototype, running CI early, and converting packages to Bazel rules gradually
- New build system simplifies and unifies development and CI environments while significantly improving cache hit rates
- Manual treatment was required for many packages, but a utility was developed to visualize migration progress
- Team achieved test parity, but some cargo features related to developer flow are not yet replicated in Bazel and many helpful tools in the cargo ecosystem don't yet have an analog in the Bazel world.

### [Anti-Porn Bills Could Force Device Censorship in 8 States](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/porn-filter-laws-bills-anti-default-florida-texas-rcna73626)

- Eight states are considering anti-pornography bills that would require phone and tablet manufacturers like Apple and Samsung to enable filters that censor nude and sexually explicit content by default.
- The bills would make device manufacturers liable for criminal and civil penalties if they don't have filters that meet "industry standards" turned on automatically.
- Many device manufacturers already have adult content filters available, though they are not typically enabled by default.
- The original intention of the model bill was to turn on adult filters for web browsers and not other applications, though the legislation could potentially apply to other filters created in recent years.
- The bills are part of a wave of legislation aimed at regulating Big Tech and filtering explicit content. However, the differences in languages state by state and the inclusion of age verification language in some bills raise concerns around user privacy and data protection.

### [Scalability Benefits of Multitenancy in Cloud Systems](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/03/23/economics.html)

- Multi-tenancy effectively reduces the peak-to-average ratio of overall system traffic
- This improves the economics of the underlying system by bringing costs closer to value
- It allows individual workloads to have higher peaks without breaking the economics of the system
- Examples: S3 and Lambda use multi-tenancy to absorb long and short spikes in load for any single workload economically
- Real-world processes behave much worse than Poisson processes, but the economic effect of multi-tenancy is still beneficial

- Trust and gatekeeping have become topics of discussion in the agile community.
- Some argue that gated check-ins, pull requests, and reviews are signs of a dysfunctional organization and a lack of trust in colleagues.
- The author posits that trust in colleagues and trust in oneself are not the issues at hand, but rather fallibility is at the root.
- Guardrails and checks in software engineering are necessary to prevent mistakes and are not indicative of a lack of trust.
- Context matters when deciding what processes to implement, as different teams may have different needs and preferences.
- The lack of trust in colleagues is not a good reason to be critical of code reviews or pull requests, as these processes are in place to catch mistakes.
