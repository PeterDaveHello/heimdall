## [OpenAI’s policies hinder reproducible research on language models](https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/openais-policies-hinder-reproducible?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

-   OpenAI's policies are hindering reproducible research on language models, which have become privately-controlled research infrastructure.
-   OpenAI's model deprecations are a concern because Language Models (LLMs) are becoming key pieces of infrastructure, and researchers and developers rely on LLMs as a foundation layer, which is then fine-tuned for specific applications or answering research questions.
-   OpenAI, like other companies, regularly updates newer models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, meaning the use of those models can be a barrier to reproducibility.
-   OpenAI's hasty deprecation of Codex has forced researchers and developers to switch to GPT 3.5 models, which are not comparable, leading to the irreproducibility of old work.
-   OpenAI has allowed researchers access to Codex, but the application process is opaque, and it's unclear how long the model will be available.
-   Open-sourcing LLMs could be a key step in ensuring reproducibility.

## [Why buying furniture is so miserable](https://www.theassemblync.com/business/high-point-furniture/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

-   The North Carolina furniture industry is facing long-term challenges due to international shifts in how furniture is made and sold
-   Rise of imported goods, poor quality products, bad customer service, and subpar refund and replacement policies contribute to the fall of the industry
-   While furniture companies are thriving with the pandemic, shipping delays and damaged goods are widespread
-   The growth of multinational companies means that the industry is currently offering services for the wealthy and cheap, too often terrible goods for everyone else

## [An Aperiodic Monotile Exists!](https://aperiodical.com/2023/03/an-aperiodic-monotile-exists/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

-   Researchers have discovered a single shape that can tile the plane and cannot be arranged to have translational symmetry.
-   The tile is made of eight kites, called "Einstein hat".
-   This is a significant discovery as geometers have been looking for this shape for over 60 years, and until now, it was unsure whether one would ever exist.
-   The researchers have shown a whole continuous family of aperiodic monotiles obtained by changing the lengths of edges in the Einstein hat.
-   The authors have put together a website that accompanies the paper proving that the Einstein hat is an aperiodic monotile. It provides an interactive tool for producing patches of the tiling.

## [Apple further cracks down on remote work by tracking employee attendance badges](https://9to5mac.com/2023/03/22/apple-remote-work-policies-monitoring/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

-   Apple is monitoring attendance via badge records to ensure employees are coming to the office at least three times per week.
-   Employees who fail to comply with in-person work requirements are given "escalating warnings".
-   Failure to comply could result in termination, but this doesn't appear to be a company-wide policy.
-   Certain teams might require in-person work five days per week, while other teams can theoretically be more lenient on requiring in-person work three days per week.
-   Apple shifted to remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but began a transitional "hybrid" return to in-person work one year ago.
-   As of last September, the policy requires in-person work at least three days per week.
-   In January, Apple adjusted its policy for COVID-19 testing, dropping the requirement that employees be tested for COVID-19 before working in-person.

## [Chinese app included malware to gain competitive advantage](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/google-suspends-chinese-e-commerce-app-pinduoduo-over-malware/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

-   Google has suspended the Chinese e-commerce app Pinduoduo after malware was found in versions of the software.
-   Chinese researchers had earlier published an analysis suggesting Pinduoduo sought to seize total control over affected devices by exploiting multiple security vulnerabilities in various Android-based smartphones.
-   Researchers at the Chinese security firm DarkNavy later published a blog post purporting to prove that a major Chinese e-commerce company’s app was using a three-exploit chain to read user data and surreptitiously phone home. They did not name the app.
-   A thread on the now-defunct cybercrime community BreachForums noted that a unique component of the malicious app code highlighted by DarkNavy also was found in the Pinduoduo application.
-   On March 4, 2023, e-commerce expert Liu Huafang posted on Weibo that Pinduoduo’s app was using security vulnerabilities to gain market share by stealing user data from its competitors. The post has since been deleted.
-   On March 7, a newly created Github account published a technical analysis claiming that until recently Pinduoduo’s source code included a “backdoor” that allowed the company to remotely and secretly connect to a compromised system at will.
-   Pinduoduo is among China’s most popular e-commerce platforms, boasting approximately 900 million monthly active users.
-   Most of the news coverage of Google’s move against Pinduoduo emphasizes that the malware was found in versions of the Pinduoduo app available outside of Google’s app store, Google Play.
-   However, Google Play is not available to consumers in China. As a result, the app will still be available via other mobile app stores catering to the Chinese market — including those operated by Huawei, Oppo, Tencent, and VIVO.

## [Raytracing on AMD’s RDNA 2/3, and Nvidia’s Turing and Pascal](https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/03/22/raytracing-on-amds-rdna-2-3-and-nvidias-turing-and-pascal/?ref=hackernewsgpt.com)

-   Raytracing accurately models light by following the paths of light rays and seeing what they hit.
-   A bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) is created for raytracing which is a tree structure that checks whether a ray intersects any child nodes.
-   AMD and Nvidia use different approaches to building their BVHs.
-   The performance of Nvidia's Pascal and Turing architectures in raytracing workloads is examined in the article.
-   AMD uses a more conventional acceleration structure that relies on a BVH format, while Nvidia uses a wider tree approach that emphasizes compute throughput.
-   Nvidia's approach may give it an edge, particularly as raytracing becomes more widely adopted.
-   There is no fundamentally right or wrong approach to BVH implementation, improvements in occupancy and caching will benefit a wide range of workloads beyond raytracing.
