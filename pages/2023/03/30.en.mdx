### Google Committed "Evidence Destruction" & Lied, Us Judge Finds

A US federal judge found that Google destroyed evidence and lied to the court in a finding with serious consequences in antitrust litigation. The judge ruled that Google employees routinely discussed substantive business topics, which may lead to an adverse inference indicating that the deleted evidence was against Google. The ruling pertains to lawsuits from Epic Games and the Department of Justice. Google failed to preserve chat records of key employees, and the judge did not sanction Google yet, but fines will be assessed when fact discovery is complete. Corporations are accountable for the actions their employees take, and individuals responsible for destroying evidence should be held accountable. Commenters suggest a scaling of fines based on the revenue of a company, similar to banks' anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism fines.

### Stone Age Humans Ate Delicacies of Rotten Meat, Researchers Suggest

Stone Age humans may have eaten delicacies of rotten meat to encourage bacteria in the gut to break down fresh meat more effectively. Early humans who relied on persistence hunting may have adapted to eating decaying meat as they had no refrigeration. Commenters discuss the idea that ancient humans had higher tolerance for spoiled meat due to adaptation over time but caution against misconceptions. Indigenous peoples across the world commonly ate putrid meat and fish, providing insight into lifestyles predating Western industrialisation and the war against germs. Neanderthals may have eaten putrid meat similar to the way arctic hunters used to, according to new research.

### Teenage Fentanyl Overdoses Surge in Hays County, Texas

Teenage fentanyl overdoses are surging in Hays County, Texas, and across the US where drug addiction is a crisis lacking real solutions. There are debates on different approaches such as decriminalization or medication for opioid addiction. Drug users are being poisoned by counterfeit prescription drugs that contain fatal doses of fentanyl, which is manufactured by Mexican drug cartels. The US plays a pivotal role due to its degree of free trade. The opioid crisis is caused by several factors, including cross-contamination and societal issues. The crisis requires a multifaceted approach, including harm reduction and addiction prevention and treatment resources. Addiction should be treated as a public health issue rather than a crime. Hays County, Texas is battling a surge in fentanyl overdoses plaguing its youth, which are mostly brought through ports of entry by US citizens due to poor access to mental health care. Better support systems are needed to address the root causes of the opioid crisis.

### Discover Data Structure with Autoencoders Algorithm

Autoencoders are neural network algorithms that can discover structure in data and generate a compressed representation of input, with three components: an encoder, bottleneck or latent representation, and a decoder. They can be used for various tasks such as data denoising, anomaly detection, and generation. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) provide a probabilistic way of describing latent space observations, forming a continuous latent space that can be easily sampled and interpolated, and enforcing a continuous, smooth latent space representation. However, autoencoders are data-specific and decompressed outputs will be degraded compared to the original inputs.

### Rfc 7807: Machine-Readable HTTP Error Details Format

RFC 7807 defines a machine-readable way to carry error details in HTTP responses, allowing for more informative error messages to be sent to non-human APIs. It provides a semi-standard structure for error details, but some believe it is over-engineered. It is currently supported on JSON and XML formats, and guidance is given on using it in arbitrary formats. Problem Details can contain a URI and other information. RFC 7807 represents common error formats for applications that need them, allowing for reuse instead of defining their own or redefining existing HTTP status codes. It is essential for APIs as it allows clients to understand what went wrong during an operation and is available in both XML and JSON formats.

### Declassified Records Suggest Bush's Oil Business Was Cia Front

Declassified records reveal that George H.W. Bush's oil business, Zapata Off-Shore, may have been a front for the CIA, with the agency gaining access to it before Bush entered politics. A memo from 1975 indicates that Bush's partner, Tom Devine, was a "cleared and witting commercial asset" and "personal friend" of Bush. While there are no proven links between Bush and JFK's assassination, Zapata Off-Shore did aid the CIA. The FBI director at that time acknowledged Bush's ties to the CIA, and he was later named as CIA director by President Ford in 1975.

### The Us Citizenship Process: Background Checks & Intimate Proof

The US citizenship process involves extensive background checks, including financial, medical, and criminal records, and some individuals express discomfort with this invasive nature. Couples must also be prepared to prove the legitimacy of their relationship, but it is not necessary to provide explicit material. Immigration laws and citizenship processes are arbitrary and differ widely between countries. The Green Card process is difficult and requires proof of a legitimate marriage, including intimate proof. Open borders are not viewed as a serious public policy solution, but the current system is bureaucratic and confusing. USCIS requires evidence of legitimate marriage, and couples have submitted graphic material, although this can negatively affect their applications. Government codes suggest certain types of unions and spouses are viewed as more "legitimate" and worthy of citizenship. Mixed-status couples have their entire relationship under scrutiny, and immigration processes across the Western world are being monitored.

### Resurgence of Gen Z Using Dumb Phones for Screen Time Limiting

Dumb phones are gaining popularity among Gen Z in the US as a way to limit screen time, despite concerns about communication limitations. Some manufacturers have addressed these concerns by offering devices with additional features, such as 4G connectivity and support for WhatsApp. Critics argue that digital detoxes may not signal a long-term shift away from smartphones.
