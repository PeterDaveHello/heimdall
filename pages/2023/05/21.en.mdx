### [Counterintuitive Properties of High Dimensional Space (2018)](https://marckhoury.github.io/blog/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/)

- Our intuition for three-dimensional geometry fails us in higher dimensions, where the properties of even simple objects can be counterintuitive.
- The radius of the inner sphere in a higher dimensional cube grows as the dimension increases, and in some dimensions, the sphere pokes outside of the cube.
- The volume of a high-dimensional unit sphere approaches zero as the dimension increases, and the vast majority of its surface area lies near the equator. The kissing number, which is the maximum number of non-overlapping spheres that can touch a central sphere, is only known exactly in a few dimensions, and it increases as the dimension increases.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36009667)

- The article explores how regular polytopes decrease in number as dimensions increase, and how it becomes harder to maintain knots in higher dimensions.
- The article discusses the concept of volume in higher dimensions, specifically the fact that the volume of a d-sphere tends to zero as d grows, and provides a critique of the explanations given in the original post, arguing that they lack clarity.
