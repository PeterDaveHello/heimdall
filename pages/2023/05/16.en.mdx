### [Kids who get smartphones earlier become adults with worse mental health](https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/sapien-smartphone-report)

- A new report from Sapien Labs reveals that younger age of receiving a smartphone is linked to worse mental health, especially for women.
- The report suggests that legislators should consider raising the minimum age or implementing age verification for social media and pornography, while schools and parents should consider alternatives such as "dumbphones" and limiting phone use in the classroom.
- While the correlation does not necessarily indicate causation, the report emphasizes the need for additional research into the sudden decline in young adult mental health, coinciding with the smartphone generation.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35948332)

- There is a debate regarding the potential benefits and dangers that smartphones offer to young people, and careful consideration of the benefits and drawbacks of smartphone use is necessary.
- Critics argue that there is no proof of causation, while proponents argue that social media and smartphone usage is the most convincing explanation for mental health decline. More research is needed.

### [Uncensored Models](https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models)

- An uncensored model refers to a huggingface transformer model that is not aligned with specific and/or ethical guidelines.
- Alignment of models is helpful for popular public-facing AI bots, but not all models need an alignment. Uncensored models offer composable alignment to prevent a 'one true correct alignment'.
- Uncensored models allow for unlimited ownership and control and are available for use by all demographic and interest groups. These models support research, creativity, intellectual curiosity, and erotic story-telling.
- To create an uncensored model, one must identify and remove refusals and biases from the dataset and train the model with the filtered dataset in the same manner as the original model was trained.
- After finetuning with a dataset, uncensored models like WizardLM-Uncensored are much more compliant than aligned models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Users are responsible for what they do with the output of these models.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35946060)

- There is a debate on whether AI models will achieve generalized intelligence similar to humans and whether it poses a threat if it did.
- AI models are currently causing real harm, such as ruining lives through facial recognition or bias in decision-making.
