### [Let us serve you, but don't bring us down](https://blog.archive.org/2023/05/29/let-us-serve-you-but-dont-bring-us-down/)

- Archive.org experienced an hour-long outage due to tens of thousands of requests per second launched from 64 virtual hosts on Amazon Web Services, which brought the site down for all users.
- Engineers scrambled on a Sunday afternoon on a holiday weekend to work on the issue, and the site got back up by blocking those IP addresses, but another 64 addresses started the same type of activity a couple of hours later.
- Those wanting to use Archive.org's materials in bulk should start slowly and ramp up, and if starting a large project, should contact the organization at info@archive.org to avoid overwhelming the site.

### [Production AI systems are hard](https://methexis.substack.com/p/production-ai-systems-are-really)

- Radiologists have a complex job that requires a 3D world model of the brain and its dynamics, making it nearly impossible to replace them entirely with AI systems.
- Automated systems cannot make determinations like radiologists because radiologists have grounded brain models, making it challenging to train AI machines to replicate their performance.
- Even creating an algorithm that could automate the work of radiologists could prove difficult given the extensive domain-specific knowledge necessary, making it unlikely that anyone will succeed in doing so.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36111596)

- AI can pre-draft 90% of diagnostic studies in radiology, but concerns exist about radiologists becoming complacent and misreading due to not reviewing output
- Challenges of sharing medical data exist due to legal and regulatory issues, differences in imaging protocols and disease prevalence between hospitals, and concerns over privacy
- AI can assist radiologists in triaging interpretation priorities and flagging abnormal scans, but human diagnostician input remains crucial for rare and challenging conditions.
