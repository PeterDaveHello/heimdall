### [Walkout at global science journal over 'unethical' fees](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/07/too-greedy-mass-walkout-at-global-science-journal-over-unethical-fees)

- Over 40 leading scientists have resigned from the editorial board of a top science journal due to what they describe as the "greed" of academic publisher Elsevier's publication charges, which they consider unethical.
- Neuroimage, a leading journal focused on brain-imaging research and one of many open access journals, charges over Â£2,700 for a research paper to be published, and academics feel that the cost bears no relation to the costs involved.
- Academics are urging fellow scientists to submit papers to a nonprofit open-access journal which the resigned team is setting up instead, and hope this marks the start of a rebellion against the large profit margins associated with academic publishing.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35848894)

- Academic publishing relies on metrics like journal rankings and citation indexes for prestige, which results in natural monopolies and high fees
- Initiatives like open access and no-cost mandates from the EU may help alleviate the problem, but financial incentives and power structures may hinder real change in the industry
