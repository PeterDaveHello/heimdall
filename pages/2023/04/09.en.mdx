### Do judges give out tougher sentences when hungry? A study too good to be true

[Original](https://inews.co.uk/news/do-judges-give-out-tougher-sentences-when-hungry-the-story-behind-a-study-too-good-to-be-true-2238347).
N/A.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35491060).
A study suggesting that judges give harsher sentences when hungry is disputed, citing experiences with fasting. Religious fasting could actually benefit judges' judgment, while short Ramadan fasts are not comparable to longer ones. Fasting experiences and opinions vary, with some noting clearness and productivity. Studies show positive correlations between cognitive performance and fasting or restricted carbohydrate diets, but more research is needed. Judges fasting during Ramadan in Pakistan were more likely to acquit defendants by 10% each additional hour fasted, but small sample size and scheduling biases were noted. Scientific studies on social phenomena are unreliable and open to differing interpretations, based on comments. The nature of science and the importance of shared truth in scientific discourse were also discussed.





### Everything advertised on social media is overpriced junk

[Original](https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/08/late-stage-sea-monkeys/#jeremys-razors).
A study by Carnegie Mellon and Pamplin College found that targeted ads on social media cost an average of 10% more and come from vendors with poor ratings, leading the study to conclude that all advertised products on social media are overpriced junk. Contextual ads perform as well and have better control over creative content. Legislative action is needed to implement an opt-in consent policy for data collection, and to regulate the ad-tech market. A federal privacy law could prevent spying by social media giants and foster competition in app stores, allowing media outlets to earn more revenue. Shifting control from Big Tech can benefit the media at large.

### Why and How We Retired Elm at Culture Amp

[Original](https://kevinyank.com/posts/on-endings-why-how-we-retired-elm-at-culture-amp/).
Culture Amp has retired Elm as its preferred language for new front-end code after four years despite its previous promotion by the company's engineering lead. The move was due to an attempt by Culture Amp's design team to build a language-agnostic library of reusable user interface components with Web Components, which demands its framework. Culture Amp chose to stick with React due to its acquisition of a company with an entirely React code base and TypeScript's ability to match Elm's state management. Culture Amp's decision reflects an increasing trend towards selecting React in TypeScript for new projects, and Elm may move from "adopt" to "contain" status on their Tech Radar. Engineers supported the decision to contain Elm due to the complexity it creates.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35495910).
Culture Amp's decision to reject job candidates with a specific language preference sparks discussions on HN, with some agreeing and others disagreeing. Some users caution against being too zealous about a technology and encourage focusing on actual indicators of expertise. Elm's challenges and decline are discussed, with suggestions for other languages. HN comments discuss company culture, design systems, and tech stack choices. A former Elm user shares their experience switching to TypeScript, while a company with difficulty maintaining two frameworks decides to phase out Elm.

### Google to Ban Financial Lending Apps from Accessing User Photos, Contacts

[Original](https://www.pcmag.com/news/google-to-ban-financial-lending-apps-from-accessing-user-photos-contacts).
Google has updated its personal loans policy to prevent apps that offer loans from accessing user contacts or photos. This move is aimed at addressing predatory behaviour from some lenders who harass and intimidate borrowers into paying outstanding debts. In addition to this, it will require country-specific licensing documentation to prove their ability to provide or facilitate personal loans, such as in Pakistan. Such practices have led to debt collectors sending manipulated photos to the friends and family of debtors, resulting in a number of targeted individuals taking their lives in countries such as India and Kenya.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35494366).
Google will ban lending apps from accessing user photos and contacts. Suggestions include a two-pronged approach in the Play Store or presenting fake data when permissions are denied. Secure core architecture promises to eliminate malware. Users complain about too many permissions and misuse of data by loan apps. Call for better regulations or a whitelist for loan app access. Privacy concerns and need for individual sharing of contacts. Need for streamlined media access function. Desktop users lack permissions limits. Alternative app stores could weaken user protections. Unique scam in Kenya. Google bans payday loan ads despite allowing them on the app store.





### Go 1.21 will (likely) have a static toolchain on Linux

[Original](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/Go121LinuxStaticToolchain).
The upcoming version of Go 1.21 will have a static toolchain on Linux, which means that the compiler will be built using the pure Go resolver only and will be a static executable, unless the developers revert for some reason. This will allow for a nice quality of life improvement for people who mostly work on recent Linuxes, but who occasionally have to deal with older ones. However, this change will not automatically make user programs version-independent. Currently, elements of the plan have already landed in the Go development version.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35490941).
Go 1.21 to have faster static toolchain on Linux, but criticisms on handling of nil pointer panics still persist. Some suggest retrofitting features without breaking backwards compatibility, but others argue against generics. Users praise ease of use and toolchain appeal of Go. Rust's borrow checker, memory safety limitations, and lifetimes are also discussed. Go's DNS resolver and reliance on libc debated, with pros and cons of dynamic vs. static linking. DNS lookup implementation on macOS discussed, building client executables in debian squeeze docker container suggested, and using Go for fully reproducible toolchain on 1.21.





### Electricity Prices by Country

[Original](https://www.electricrate.com/data-center/electricity-prices-by-country/).
The article delves into the cost and sources of electricity across countries, revealing how Germany and Bermuda are the most expensive while Sudan, Venezuela, and Iran are the cheapest. Most countries still primarily depend on fossil fuels for electricity generation. Notably, the US has the highest household electricity usage but a similar cost to the global average. Furthermore, 13% of the world's population is still without access to electricity. It's important to consider access and sustainability when analyzing electricity prices, with cheap prices often causing harm to the environment.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35495579).
An article on "Electricity Prices by Country" gains attention on Hacker News, as readers discuss factors such as regional energy usage differences and propane usage in rural areas. Users share their experiences in drastically reducing energy consumption, while others point out flaws in data and express surprise at low energy usage. Regional variations in pricing due to geography and political policies are significant, and prices should be normalized by local average income for a fair comparison. Argentine and Venezuelan subsidies spark concerns, while critics suggest simplistic data comparisons for marketing purposes. Germany's high prices are attributed to the cost of natural gas, while Swede and UK prices are cited as not matching on-the-ground costs. The article covers electricity prices in African countries, though commenters note flaws in using averages to describe the entire sample, and the irrelevance of prices without electricity availability.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has alerted the Eastside Free Methodist Church, based in Portland, that an unlicensed FM radio station, operating on 90.5 FM, has been identified to be operating under its steeple. Field agents from the FCC tracked the pirate radio but did not find any individuals currently there, and the church maybe closed according to the online postings available. It is probable that the church will face enforcement action under federal law, as it owns the building. Any evidence should be submitted to prove that the pirate radio broadcasting no longer occurs at the premises. The warning letter sent to the church indicates that it will face a penalty worth more than $2.3m in fines.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35496871).
The FCC warned a Portland church to shut down a pirate FM radio station under its steeple. Such stations can interfere with emergency communication, and are not part of EAS. However, some consider pirate stations necessary for independent voices. The caught pirate was fined $80,000 and had numerous warnings. Discussion on the regulation, legality, and efficiency of radio use and allocation ensued, with suggestions for LPFM stations. Interference can be caused by the overlap of analogue and digital signals. Some Norway radio enthusiasts are discussing FM pirate stations.

### Custom Allocators in Rust

[Original](https://nical.github.io/posts/rust-custom-allocators.html).
NicalIndex discusses custom allocators in Rust for improved memory allocation strategies, enabling different parts of a program to choose strategies. Rust has a default global allocator, with two proposals for custom allocator support. The article explores approaches to custom allocators in Rust data structures, focusing on the fill tessellator implementation in the lyon library. Different approaches involve lifetime parameters, two structures, or a manually managed trait object. Adding custom allocators is easy and should utilize the Allocator trait for the best abstraction. Recycling allocations and choosing the right allocator for specific code parts are options for developers. The Allocator trait must be stabilized for Storage implementations to leverage it.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35491936).
Rust may support dynamic scoping for custom allocators despite the unsafe API challenge. Efforts are being made to combine custom allocators with Rust's 'std' types. The 'big box' issue in allocator API requires safer custom allocation handling in Rust. Passing containers and lifetime annotations can solve Rust's default allocation problem. Lifetime system may enhance library design but not optimization. A user seeks input on custom allocators for tensor operations.

A new Spotify streaming GDPR dump local analyzer has been created, allowing users to analyze their own data. Users can request an export of their data and then analyze it using the tool. While some users are excited about this, others find it creepy that Spotify tracks mood and location data. Several comments on the thread digress from the main point of the article, but there are requests for more tools like this to make sense of GDPR dumps.





### Hacking Google ReCAPTCHA v3 Using Reinforcement Learning (2019)

[Original](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01003).
Researchers have developed a reinforcement learning methodology to bypass Google's reCAPTCHA v3. In formulating the problem as a grid world, the agents can learn how to move the mouse and click on the reCAPTCHA button to receive a high score, which means the methodology uses a divide and conquer strategy to defeat this captcha system for any grid resolution. The proposed method achieves a success rate of 97.4% on a 100x100 grid and 96.7% on a 1000x1000 screen resolution. The authors also show that increasing the cell size reduces the performance of the agent.

### Ex-S.F. fire commissioner with fractured skull after metal pipe attack

[Original](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/marina-sf-crime-attack-fire-commissioner-17883532.php).
Former San Francisco fire commissioner, Don Carmignani, was hospitalized with a fractured skull and 51 stitches after being attacked with a metal object while leaving his mother's house in the Marina District. Authorities have arrested a man for the alleged assault. His friend, Joe Alioto Veronese, claimed that Carmignani was beaten by three men who lived in a nearby homeless neighborhood. Veronese speculates that the attack might have been retribution for a phone call Carmignani made on Tuesday when he requested that police remove loiterers in front of his mother's home. The incident has raised concerns about safety in the city.

An ex-SF fire commissioner was attacked, sparking discussion on SF's crime problem and law enforcement. Users suggest stricter law enforcement and at-large elections. Social services are deemed insufficient, and gun laws are debated. Lack of government and public safety, and desensitization of people, are identified as causes, and starting points for change. Political will and dogma are obstacles, with speculation that fund aid could be indirectly hurting combatting crime. The conversation revolves around solutions to SF's issues, Second Amendment and gun control, and citizens being informed of rights and responsibilities.
