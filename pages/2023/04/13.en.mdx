### Semaphore: A Full-Body Keyboard

[Original](https://github.com/everythingishacked/Semaphore).
Semaphore is a full-body keyboard that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe's Pose detection to detect body landmarks from video input, calculate relative differences, and translate them into keys and commands sent via keyboard. The primary input is to "type" letters, digits, and symbols via flag semaphore by extending both arms at various angles, with other modifier gestures included for functions such as shift, backspace, and arrow keys. It runs on the latest MacOS and can be accessed through the terminal with the use of a custom keyboard library.
