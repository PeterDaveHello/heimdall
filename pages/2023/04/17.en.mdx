Booking.com is facing criticism over its use of high-pressure sales tactics, including urgency messaging and pop-ups that can deter users. Critics argue that this approach prioritizes short-term metrics over long-term customer loyalty. Users report having found ways to work around these tactics, including using extensions to block or filter them. Meanwhile, HN users debate the merits of A/B testing, with some pointing to its potential to create "dark patterns" on websites. Despite these concerns, many users continue to use booking aggregators like Booking.com and Expedia, either for convenience or because they offer favorable prices and cancellation policies. Some experts caution that booking directly with hotels can offer better dispute resolution options, while others point out that commission rates for booking sites can vary widely depending on the hotel. Nevertheless, loyalty programs from hotels can provide significant benefits to frequent travelers.

### 'Algebra for none' fails in San Francisco

[Original](https://www.joannejacobs.com/post/algebra-for-none-fails-in-san-francisco).
San Francisco Unified school district's "Algebra for none" policy failed to improve the achievement of black and Hispanic students in advanced math, according to a study by Stanford professors, resulting in a widening achievement gap. The decision to delay algebra until ninth grade and place low-achieving and high-achieving students in the same classes did not help low-performing students and made it harder for high-achieving students to succeed. Families that can afford it have turned to online courses or private schools. A group of parents has filed a lawsuit against the district, claiming it violates state law on equitable access to advanced math.
