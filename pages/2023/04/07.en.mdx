### If we lose the Internet Archive, we’re screwed

[Original](https://www.sbstatesman.com/2023/04/04/if-we-lose-the-internet-archive-were-screwed/).
The Internet Archive, which describes itself as "a non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more," has been sued by four corporate publishers for committing copyright infringement, and a federal judge has ruled in favor of the publishers. However, the Internet Archive is appealing the decision, which some argue is fundamentally a strike against taxpayer-funded public services by corporations and private individuals. Critics argue that shutting down the National Emergency Library, which made copyrighted books available for free during the COVID-19 pandemic, is far more disastrous to the working class than access to books can ever be. If the appeal is unsuccessful, human beings will lose more knowledge than the Library of Alexandra ever contained.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35468753).

### What happens when you leak AWS credentials and how AWS minimizes the damage

[Original](https://xebia.com/blog/what-happens-when-you-leak-aws-credentials-and-how-aws-minimizes-the-damage/).
An AWS user intentionally leaked their AWS credentials to a public GitHub repository to see what would happen. Within a minute of leaking the credentials, AWS added a "Quarantine Policy" to the user account and informed the user via email with instructions on how to secure their account. A malicious actor quickly made automated API calls with the leaked credentials, but were unsuccessful due to limited permissions. AWS uses a GitHub Secrets Scanning service to quickly detect and respond to leaked credentials. To prevent credential leakage, users can run pre-commit scans locally or add a secret scanner to their CI/CD pipeline.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35466675).
An HN user set up a project to automatically leak AWS secrets & trigger scanning processes. It's frustrating to rotate keys with many in an account. AWS invalidates tokens in public repositories, but rogues may have access already. AWS users advised to talk to team before revoking keys in production. AWS support should be contacted ASAP after an attack. Additional security can be added by limiting key usage to certain IPs. A script or git hook can prevent pushing of credentials. Scanner's programming intent is unclear.

### DevOps uses a capability model, not a maturity model

[Original](https://octopus.com/blog/devops-uses-capability-not-maturity).
DevOps should use a capability model, not a maturity model, according to Steve Fenton. Unlike a maturity model, the approach is outcome-based and encourages experimentation with tools and processes. SEM-based, customizable, and dynamic; it can drive incremental gains by identifying capabilities. Maturity models can be rigid, standardized, and not consider unique business challenges. The capability model connects characteristics to wider system outcomes. The structural model is overwhelming, but should be used for continuous improvement.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35466718).
DevOps transformed dev team's roles and pushed higher SysAdmin skill levels. Some suggest alternative terms like "platform engineering." Metrics-based capability model criticized as a sales pitch, call for meaningful capabilities. Cultivate a culture of trying new things for business development.





### Adding capacity to the electricity grid is not a simple task

[Original](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2023/04/05/adding-capacity-to-the-electricity-grid-is-not-a-simple-task).
The electricity grid faces challenges in integrating renewable sources, with few providers willing to expand transformer capacity. Conservative regulation and insufficient grid connections limit renewable market share, causing delays and uncertainty in new projects. Regulators acknowledge the need for long-range connections for grid decarbonization, with new regulations to support renewable energy projects. India plans to connect 500GW of renewable capacity by 2030, while China benefits from recent grid expansion. However, optimizing queue management and planning procedures remains crucial, as grid infrastructure construction must balance delicate balances.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35463182).
Adding capacity to the electricity grid faces challenges in permits, environmental laws, property ownership, eminent domain, and finding unregistered owners. Countries face unique grid problems, including South Africa's neglected power network and the Netherlands' grid capacity unable to keep up with investments. Old grid infrastructure is being reused for new off-shore wind farms in the UK, but many green projects have dates in the 2030s. Stability in grid vs. promoting renewable energy sources and the need for hydrogen for energy storage is discussed. Challenges of renewables include overbuilding, storage, and grid connectivity. South Africans have fewer power outages in countries like Germany and Austria. China is leading in ultra-high voltage DC transmission. Renewables have never been a problem for grids, although synthetic inertia and management of sudden supply drops remain a challenge.

### MutexProtected: A C++ Pattern for Easier Concurrency

[Original](https://awesomekling.github.io/MutexProtected-A-C++-Pattern-for-Easier-Concurrency/).
The article explains the challenges of programming concurrent applications using locks and presents a C++ pattern called MutexProtected that simplifies this process. The author uses an example in C to demonstrate the need for MutexProtected and prepares a barebones example. The article then introduces a C++ RAII class to solve the problem of forgotten mutex unlocking but shows its shortcomings. The author then presents MutexProtected as a powerful construct that combines a mutex and data type to ensure correct concurrent access to data. The article concludes with the introduction of MemoizedTreeMap, an implementation of a tree-based map that uses MutexProtected to ensure thread safety.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35464152).
MutexProtected is a C++ pattern for easy concurrency like Rust's mutexes. Boost.synchronized is complex, but can be used header-only. Comments suggest lambda and RAII-style or explicit lock and unlock, and scoped_lock for multiple locks. Experts debate mutexes versus channels for concurrency.





### Clarence Thomas and the Billionaire

[Original](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow).
ProPublica reports that Justice Clarence Thomas allegedly accepted luxury trips from Republican donor Harlan Crow for over two decades, without disclosing them on annual financial disclosures, raising ethical concerns. Crow, who spent millions on conservative politics, owns a yacht and private jet on which Thomas has travelled, and has hosted him at his Texas ranch and private resort. Crow's access to the justice extends to anyone the businessman chooses to invite along, potentially violating disclosure laws. The updated ethics guidance for judges clarifies that disclosure is required for such stays, including a 2021 trip to a Catholic cemetery near New York City where a bronze statue of Thomas' eighth-grade teacher was unveiled with funding from Crow.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35467948).
An essential US Supreme Court Justice could be embroiled in significant corruption as he may have received illicit favors from a billionaire; however, it is unlikely these actions would lead to an impeachment in today's ultra-political climate. While Justice Thomas may not be bound by lower courts' ethical rules, legal action may still be taken, including a Department of Justice or IRS investigation. The apparent corruption from the level of the judiciary highlights the corrupting influence of the super-rich on government institutions, with predictable success so far. Despite being flagrantly against the law, Justice Thomas' actions may go without penalty, partially because of a refusal to hold those in power to account.

Device Tree (DT) additions for Apple's M2 devices, including MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini, will be added to Linux 6.4. Hector Martin, Asahi Linux's lead developer, submitted the Apple SoC DT updates for queuing into the SoC tree ahead of the merge window's opening at the end of the month. Adding the Apple M2 Device Tree series and support for the essential hardware of the machines on the DT will bring much-needed upstream kernel support for the Apple M2. However, the device is still not yet usable for end-users, and individuals wanting the best Apple M1/M2 Linux experience will need to use a downstream distribution like Asahi Linux.

Linux 6.4 adds Apple M2 support for 2022 MacBook/Mac Mini. HN users compare Linux/MacOS power management. Asahi Linux not yet a perfect solution. Some excitement but frustration with quality of comments. Users lament misinformation/nonsense. Quality of discussion has deteriorated in a particular domain. One user suggests blocking it. Rest of thread seems unaffected.





### Illustrations of ‘unseen’ Japanese maintenance trains that only work at night

Artist Masami Onishi has illustrated Japan's rarely seen workforce of overnight trains that perform maintenance work on tracks and electrical wires during the early morning hours, which ensures smooth and uninterrupted service throughout the day. The detailed illustrations of these trains are part of the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation's Project Toei. They include the “Rail Grinding Carriage” that smooths out abrasions on the rails, and the “Electric Inspection Carriage” that assesses the height, voltage and conditions of overhead electric lines. Japan's railways have a remarkably low rate of derailments, with only two such incidents recorded across the country in 2018.

Illustrations of 'unseen' Japanese maintenance trains only working at night, highlighted through Project Toei. NYC locals comment on inadequate 24/7 subway maintenance, some blaming outdated vocations such as door operators. Depicts contrasting clean Tokyo subway cars and poor maintenance in New York, leading to discussion of poor infrastructure in other American cities. Japanese railways benefit from private investors and government funding, contrasting American public transport loss, viewed as a public good. Tokyo Metropolitan Government owns many trains, maintained through sophisticated AI systems, with plans to be fully autonomous by 2032. Tokyo rush hour is less uncomfortable than London or New York, with reserved seating.
