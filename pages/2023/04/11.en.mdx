### The Kissimmee River has been brought back to life, and wildlife is thriving

[Original](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/kissimmee-biggest-river-restoration-ever-completed).
The article reports on the restoration of the Kissimmee River in Florida, which is responsible for much of the water flowing into the Northern Everglades, where Disney World is located. Sixty years ago, the river meandered for over 100 miles and was home to seasonal wetlands rich with wildlife. However, in response to floods and hurricanes, the state asked the Army Corps of Engineers to build a sprawling network of canals and waterways to drain the land, turning the river into a 30-foot-deep straight canal. A recently completed project has restored the curves of the river and replenished the wetlands, bringing back waterfowl, raptors, fish, and mammals.

### Shutting down nuclear power could increase air pollution: study

[Original](https://news.mit.edu/2023/study-shutting-down-nuclear-power-could-increase-air-pollution-0410).
A study by MIT shows that closing down nuclear power plants in the US could increase air pollution, causing over 5,000 premature deaths, particularly impacting African American communities living close to fossil fuel plants. The researchers found that pollutants generated by coal, natural gas, and renewable energy sources would fill the gap left by nuclear energy, making air quality worse, and if renewable energy does fill the gap by 2030, pollution-related deaths could increase to 260. MIT engineers also developed D2X, a debugging tool for programming languages, as well as a modelling framework for grid-scale energy storage flow batteries.

### Xylazine, a dangerous new drug fuelling Canada’s opioid crisis

[Original](https://macleans.ca/society/what-is-xylazine-the-dangerous-new-drug-fuelling-canadas-opioid-crisis/).
Xylazine, a powerful sedative typically used on large animals, is a new dangerous substance that has amplified the toxicity of Canada's drug supply, found in 1,350 drug seizures in Ontario and British Columbia. Xylazine is known by some users as "tranq" or "zombie drug" and is sometimes combined with fentanyl, which currently has no antidote. Xylazine is also utilized as a filler to create more drugs, increasing their potency and price for human consumption. Physical responses to xylazine vary, and it is difficult to tell if someone has ingested it. To mitigate its effects, experts suggest having a regulated, safe drug supply and more harm-prevention roles.
