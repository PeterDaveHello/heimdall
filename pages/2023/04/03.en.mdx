### HP notorious for region-locking printers & cartridges, causing frustration & wasted money

<strong>How to change the region on an HP OfficeJet printer in 57 easy steps.</strong>
HP is known for region-locking its printers and cartridges, leading to frustration and wasted money for customers. Printer manufacturers find various tactics to extract more money from customers, including blocking third-party ink cartridges, preventing cartridge refills, and remotely bricking printers if ink subscriptions are canceled. The author shares their experience of resetting the region lock on their HP printer, which took months of calls with customer support and a key generation utility to finally achieve. Commenters suggest using open-source software and free printers at libraries. Consumer laws protect returning incompatible cartridges and refilling originals, while off-brand ink may bypass region locks. The EU should investigate limiting consumers to forced-expiring, half-empty consumables with DRMs or other anti-consumer rules. Non-DRM ink in refillable reservoirs saves users money.

### US Poverty Programs Fail Despite Trillions Spent: Financial Times

<strong>‘America does so much more to subsidise affluence than alleviate poverty’.</strong>
US poverty programs have failed to reduce poverty despite the government spending nearly $1tn annually to fund 126 different programs to combat poverty; this amounts to a total allocation of $16tn over the last 50 years; one reason for their inefficiency is that many programs focus on spending money rather than giving cash handouts directly to poor people; roughly 15% of Americans still live in poverty, and nearly 22% of children live in poverty today.

### Experts Concerned Over £55K Salary for Key UK Cybersecurity Head

<strong>UK Treasury trying to find a Head of Cyber Security for £55k.</strong>
The £55k salary for the UK Cybersecurity Head is drawing concern from experts as the basic cost of living is not taken into account, especially in London. Job offers in LinkedIn and Glassdoor show dev salaries rapidly decreasing in the UK, with many skilled workers looking to leave the country. There's a fixed class struggle and the pay structure needs a revamp; insiders suggest that nepotism and class discrimination are creeping in. The job titles can be misleading, and in this cybersecurity job case, headline contradicts the job listing. The UK Treasury doesn't seem to understand the relative weakness of wage growth over the last ten years, and is risking being fleeced with this low salary cybersecurity job.

### Compostable food containers may release toxic chemicals into the air

<strong>Compostable fast-food packaging can emit volatile PFAS.</strong>
A new study found that compostable fast-food containers may release toxic chemicals known as PFAS into the air. Some compostable packaging may not be environmentally-friendly and release methane in landfills. However, some manufacturers are phasing out PFAS in compostable bowls by replacing them with plant-based coatings. Reusable packaging is the best solution for going green. Food packaging toxicity is receiving increasing attention, and using biodegradable packaging like paper and glass may be safer. Researchers suggest a ban on all PFAS in food packaging. Total PFAS levels drop up to 85% after two years of storage due to volatilization of fluorotelomer alcohols and other PFAS.

### Canada experiences rise in remote work despite employer pressures

<strong>Work-from-home is the new normal in Canada.</strong>
Despite employer pressure to return to the office, Canada has seen a rise in remote work that continues to gain popularity, according to a new study. While the shift has provided benefits for those who can work from home, there are potential issues for those in industries where remote work is not feasible. Governments and businesses should accept this change as the new norm. Comments on the National Post article reflect on the challenges and benefits of remote work, with discussions on its impact on lower-income workers, public transit, and housing affordability. The argument that productivity and innovation suffer from remote work is challenged, with some commenters pointing out its advantages in terms of flexibility, avoiding commutes, and cheaper housing. The prevalence of contractors and socialized medicine in Canada and Europe may contribute to the popularity of remote work.

### Andreesen Horowitz pursues investment from Saudi Arabia amid tensions

<strong>Andreessen Horowitz is now openly courting capital from Saudi Arabia.</strong>
Andreesen Horowitz seeks investment from Saudi Arabia despite tensions. The VC firm has been mocked in recent years for major investments in 'web3' startups with no returns, and seeking Saudi investment is seen as a sign of desperation. The Saudis are known for aggressive investment in passive vehicles. However, the move has been criticized by some who question the firm's ethics, given Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, with one Twitter user likening the situation to the Russ Hanneman storyline in the TV show Silicon Valley.

### 77% of young Americans too unfit or ill for military service

<strong>Study: 77% of young Americans too fat, mentally ill, on drugs to join military.</strong>
A Pentagon study has shown that 77% of young Americans do not qualify for military service due to being overweight, taking drugs, having mental or physical challenges, or a combination of these. Overweight hurdles, drugs and alcohol abuse, medical or physical health, and mental health are the top four reasons for disqualifications, where 44% of ineligible individuals are disqualified due to multiple reasons. The proportion of youth eligible and not enrolled in college is 12%. The declining veteran population and the shrinking military footprint contribute to an overreliance on military stereotypes resulting in recruitment challenges, according to the Major Charlie Dietz, a Department of Defense spokesman. There are concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine mandate that ended for the U.S. military, and some lawmakers are pushing to eliminate some of the disqualifying conditions.

### Twitter algorithm down-ranks tweets about Ukraine after new owner Elon Musk takes over: Analysis code reveals

<strong>Analysis of Twitter algorithm reveals Twitter down-ranks tweets about Ukraine.</strong>
Twitter algorithm code analysis reveals that tweets related to Ukraine were down-ranked after Elon Musk took over the platform, as discovered by users who inspected the recently open-sourced code. Musk's stance on Ukraine has been ambiguous, despite providing Starlink internet terminals to the country. The move towards transparency with the open-sourcing of the algorithm code has been welcomed by many users, but concerns were raised about the potential for gaming the algorithm or the possibility of botnets exploiting it. The down-ranking of Ukraine-related tweets by the algorithm has affected users who frequently post about Ukraine topics. There is speculation on whether the down-ranking is due to malice, incompetence, or low engagement levels. The Twitter code is for Twitter Spaces, rather than home timeline ranking, and a significant criticism is the ability to manipulate visibility for users by remotely throttling engagement to filter or censor content on the user's end.
