### Micro- and nanoplastics breach the blood–brain barrier in mice

#### [News](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/13/8/1404)
- Microplastics and nanoplastics can breach the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice, potentially causing toxic effects.
- Nanometer-sized particles can reach the brain in just two hours after gavage, but larger particles cannot.
- The "biomolecular corona," which forms around the surface of particles, is critical in determining if they can pass through the BBB.
- The type of corona can significantly impact toxicity, so future research is needed to fully understand the health implications and toxic mechanisms of micro- and nanoplastics.
- The study used molecular dynamics simulations to show how polystyrene nanoparticles diffuse across a model blood-brain barrier, and fluorescent nanoplastics were found in mouse brains just two hours after administration.
