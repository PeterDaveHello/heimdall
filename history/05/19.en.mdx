### [Why is my dryer radioactive?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/764460/why-is-my-dryer-radioactive)

- A Geiger counter measures radiation levels, and during a dryer cycle, it measures a higher level than normal background radiation.
- Uranium and thorium in heavy rocks can diffuse out as radon into the air and accumulate in poorly ventilated areas, like a concrete basement with granite countertops.
- Electrically-polarized molecules attracted to statically charged surfaces in a clothes dryer explain the higher radiation level measured by the Geiger counter.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35990858)

### [European standards bodies are inaccessible to Open Source projects](https://blog.opensource.org/another-issue-with-the-cyber-resilience-act-european-standards-bodies-are-inaccessible-to-open-source-projects/)

- The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) proposes that European standards bodies develop suitable standards to simplify conformance, but the European Standardisation Organizations (ESO) are corporate-controlled and expensive to engage.
- None of these standards development organizations - CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI - are accessible to open-source projects, and ETSI is predominantly controlled by telecoms industries and celebrates its role as a proponent of FRAND licensing, which is incompatible with open-source communities.
- Bert Hubert argues that standards bodies making related standards must consult and include the open-source community, or else developers will be forced to pay for third-party process auditors to achieve conformity assessment.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35985590)

- Some commenters criticize the lack of vision and the need for accessible and inexpensive standards to promote economic growth.
- Open source developers and advocates raise concerns over EU legislation that could impose fines for noncompliance, cutting off small competitors who cannot afford certification.

### [Supreme Court rules Andy Warhol's Prince art is copyright infringement](https://petapixel.com/2023/05/18/supreme-court-rules-andy-warhols-prince-art-is-copyright-infringement/)

- The United States Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Lynn Goldsmith in The Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith case, stating that Warhol's use of Goldsmith's photo of Prince was not fair use but copyright infringement.
- The court held that new expression, meaning, or message may be relevant to whether a copying use has a distinct purpose or character, but it is not dispositive of the first factor.
- This case is being celebrated as a win for photographers, as it adds clarification to what constitutes "transformation" in the context of fair use analysis and will have wide-ranging implications for intellectual property.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35991725)

- The ruling sparked discussion about the legal concept of transformative art, the inheritability of intellectual property, and the complicated mess caused by eternal copyrights.
- The posts include debates about the legality of copying artwork, the use of generative AI to create artwork, and suggestions for reform of copyright laws.

### [Language models cost much more in some languages than others](https://blog.yenniejun.com/p/all-languages-are-not-created-tokenized)

- Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens for language models to process and generate text sequences
- Different languages have varying tokenization processes, resulting in some languages requiring up to 10x more tokens than English to tokenize equivalent messages
- Language disparity in tokenization could limit the amount of information a model can process, cost more money, and take longer to run.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35983707)

- English's dominance is due to its prevalence rather than efficiency, and there are concerns about the implications of the Anglophone internet and the potential cultural supremacy of those who can impose their language.
