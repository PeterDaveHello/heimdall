### [Brute.Fail: Watch brute force attacks fail in real time](https://brute.fail/)

- Brute.Fail showcases real-time examples of attackers trying to break into servers by guessing usernames and passwords.
- The website assures that there are no legitimate services being offered on the attempted addresses and therefore, no chance of real users accidentally submitting their credentials.
- Brute.Fail is created by Mike Damm, and it is still waiting for WebSocket.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36169954)

- Using fail2ban can conserve server resources by stopping responses to brute force attacks but may not prevent them.
- Cryptographic keys and Role-Based Access Control are better alternatives to prevent attacks than passwords.
- Real-time honeypots and open-source tools can be used to monitor and protect servers.
- The website "brute.fail" streams live data showing attempts to log into SSH-enabled servers and is a valuable resource for those interested in security.
- Users should exercise caution before attempting to interact with the website as it can be easily vandalized.
- The website's purpose is to illustrate how brute force attacks work, rather than to report actual failed login attempts.

### [Radiation-hardened Quine (2014)](https://github.com/mame/radiation-hardened-quine)

- Radiation-hardened Quine is a self-printing program written in Ruby that works even if you delete a character from the code.
- The program can be run normally or with a script that randomly deletes a character to generate a broken program that still outputs the original code.
- There are different versions of Quine, and the latest version is rquine.rb, which is based on flagitious's approach and works with 1.9 or later.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36162164)

- A radiation-hardened quine that can tolerate deletion of one character without affecting its executability is shared by a hacker on Hacker News.
- People discuss the process of radiation hardening and suggest the use of triple redundancy and pooling of computational power to address potential issues during the process.
- There is a debate in the comments about whether DNA can be considered a radiation-hardened quine; the post is notable for its impressive programming feats and may intrigue readers new to programming.

### [How to make fancy road trip maps with R and OpenStreetMap](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/06/01/geocoding-routing-openstreetmap-r/)

- Andrew Heiss explains how he used OpenStreetMap, R, `sf`, and `ggplot2` to create road trip maps.
- He uses geocoding and routing through Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) API as an alternative to Google Maps.
- He provides R code to automate the process and make maps, including adding itinerary and summary statistics.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36159864)

- Commenters discuss historical and geological information about regions along the road trip route- Debate on the use of R versus Python for making maps- Some commenters share their own experiences with trip planning and suggest tools or libraries for creating maps

### [Scan iPhone backups for traces of compromise by "Operation Triangulation"](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/triangle_check)

- A new script called Triangle Check can scan iTunes backups for indicators of compromise by "Operation Triangulation".
- The script requires installation of a dependency called colorama and can be installed from PyPI or built into a pip package.
- If there are any traces of suspicious activity found by the script, it will print out more information and detected IOCs, which could mean the device was compromised.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36164340)

- Kaspersky Lab has released "Operation Triangulation," a tool that can scan iPhone backups for compromise.
- End-to-end encrypted calls may not be reliable due to device compromise, but open-source VoIP apps with E2EE alternatives exist.
- Other tools, such as the Mobile Verification Toolkit and the iMazing tool to detect Pegasus and Graphite, have been released to identify potential device compromises.

### [It's not wrong that "ü§¶üèº‚ôÇ".length == 7 (2019)](https://hsivonen.fi/string-length/)

- The article explores the different ways programming languages define and measure string length, specifically when it comes to Unicode and emojis.
- The choice of which length method to use depends on the needs of the program or project, and the decision to compute string lengths eagerly or lazily depends on the programming language and project needs.
- Measuring the length of a tweet on Twitter is complicated due to discrepancies in how different languages require different amounts of space, and scalar values provide the most fair standard for measuring length, but significant disparities still exist depending on the language.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36159443)

- The article discusses the ambiguity of the "length" attribute for strings and suggests that it be replaced with more precise descriptors.
- The comments section debates the best approach for dealing with strings in Unicode code points, bytes, or graphemes clusters, with some disagreement about which approach is best.
- The discussion covers the practicality of different methods, including using code points, grapheme clusters, or byte counts, with references to tools and libraries that can help with text manipulation.
