### [Supreme Court strikes down affirmative action in college admissions](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-29/supreme-court-strikes-down-affirmative-action-in-college-admissions)

- The Supreme Court has struck down affirmative action policies at colleges and universities that use race as a factor in admissions decisions, ruling that they are illegally discriminating based on race and violating the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.
- Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. stated that the Constitution forbids treating people differently based on their race and that students should be treated based on their experiences as individuals, not on the basis of race.
- The impact of the rulings is likely to be limited in California, as the state already prohibits the use of race as an admissions factor in public universities, but the ruling extends the prohibition to private universities as well.

### [Monster gravitational waves spotted for first time](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02167-7)

- Researchers have used pulsars, beacon stars in the Galactic neighborhood, to detect monster gravitational waves for the first time.
- The waves are much larger and longer than the waves detected in 2015, with wavelengths of up to tens of light years.
- This discovery could provide evidence of the existence of thousands of pairs of supermassive black holes in the Universe and their mergers, which will be further studied by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission.
