### [Customers don't want chat bots](https://creativegood.com/blog/23/why-customers-dont-want-chat-bots.html)

- CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, predicts that chat bots will replace human customer service representatives, leading to the elimination of certain jobs.
- The focus of the tech industry is on the financial benefits and profit margins of implementing chat bot technology, rather than considering the needs and preferences of customers.
- Customers often seek human customer service representatives for help with complex or specific issues that cannot be easily solved by an app or website, highlighting the importance of human interaction in customer service.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36625302)

- Customers often find chatbots unhelpful and incapable of solving specific or complex issues.
- The underlying problem is that many companies have complex and incompatible data systems, which hinders the effectiveness of any system, including chatbots.
- Companies prioritize cost-saving measures and innovation over providing effective customer support, leading to frustration with chatbots.

### [ProtonMail Rewrites Your Emails](http://jfloren.net/b/2023/7/7/0)

- The ProtonMail Android client has been causing issues with sending complete emails, prompting the author to look for alternative email clients.
- To avoid these issues, the author set up Proton Bridge in a virtual machine on their NAS and used rinetd to forward connections to the bridge. This allowed them to use any Android email client and Claws on Linux to access their Proton account.
- However, when the author tried to use PGP signing on their outgoing messages, they encountered problems with the MIME structure of their emails. ProtonMail has a longstanding issue with breaking outgoing PGP signatures.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36639530)

- ProtonMail does not support user-applied PGP signatures due to its automatic signing and encryption system.
- ProtonMail's response to this issue has received criticism.
- Privacy is an important consideration when choosing a secure email service.

### [TypeScript please give us reflection/runtime types](https://github.com/akutruff/typescript-needs-types)

- The post discusses the need for TypeScript to emit runtime type information in order to solve issues related to serialization and validation in real-world projects.
- The author urges the TypeScript team to prioritize tackling the problem of serialization and provide a detailed documentation or recommended library to address this issue.
- The lack of runtime type information leads to the use of convoluted libraries and workarounds, defeating the purpose of type erasure in TypeScript. The author suggests alternatives such as a higher-order function or F# Type Providers to solve this problem.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36637221)

- The post discusses the idea of TypeScript emitting runtime type information and the debate surrounding this feature.
- Some developers argue that runtime type reflection in TypeScript would enable runtime type safety and validation, while others believe it would violate TypeScript's design goals and add unnecessary complexity.
- Existing libraries and tools are mentioned as alternatives for achieving runtime type reflection and validation in TypeScript.
