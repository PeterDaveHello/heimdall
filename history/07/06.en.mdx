### [Why is desalination so difficult?](https://practical.engineering/blog/2023/6/28/why-is-desalination-so-difficult)

- Desalination, the process of removing salt from seawater, is a difficult and energy-intensive technology that only provides less than 1% of global water needs despite operating more than 18,000 desalination plants worldwide.
- The two main methods of desalination are distillation, which involves boiling and condensing water, and reverse osmosis, which uses pressure to push water through a membrane while leaving behind salt and impurities.
- Desalination plants face challenges such as high energy consumption, the need for pretreatment to remove contaminants, disposal of concentrated saline waste, and the high costs associated with building and operating these plants. However, desalination can be a viable solution in areas with severe water scarcity and can provide a reliable source of water during drought conditions.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36602909)

- Desalination is a challenging process due to the unique properties of salt and its interaction with water.
- Disposal of waste brine, a byproduct of desalination, is a major challenge with potential negative effects on ecosystems.
- More research and innovation are needed to make desalination more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable.
